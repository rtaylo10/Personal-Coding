What is Holland?

JERRY (ALSO WEARING A MOUSTACHE)
What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a
country right next to Belgium.

GEORGE
No, that's the Netherlands.

JERRY
Holland *is* the Netherlands.

GEORGE
Then who are the Dutch?

JERRY (PICKING AT HIS MOUSTACHE)
You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.

GEORGE
I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star.

JERRY
I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.

GEORGE
Well why didn't we?

JERRY
Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from
ourselves. That's what you said.

GEORGE
What if we grew muttonchops?

JERRY
No.

GEORGE
Buzz cuts? Parachute pants!

JERRY
Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.

GEORGE(RESIGNED)
Dammit.
New scene.
George approaches Jerry at the bar of a nightclub, carrying a cane.

GEORGE
Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?

JERRY
No more crutches, that must be a relief.

GEORGE
Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions.

JERRY
Not with a cane?

GEORGE
Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story.
You through with those?
George uses the cane handle to drag a bowl of pretzels over from the other end
of the bar.

JERRY
Always a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy
from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at
a pilot.

GEORGE
Alright, we're back in!

JERRY
We? No.

CLUB ANNOUNCER (OFF CAMERA)
Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania.
Applause from off camera, then Bania walks up to the bar.

BANIA
Thank you, thank you, (To Jerry) Hey, Jerry, didja see me up there? I
was killing, Jerry. Killing. I killed.

JERRY
Killed?

BANIA
Killed. (pause) I'm gonna go pick up some chicks. Good looking ones,

TOO! (WALKING AWAY)
Hey, what's your name?

GEORGE
Killed.

JERRY
Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish
that attaches himself to the shark.

GEORGE
And you're the shark?

JERRY
Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.

GEORGE
I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.

JERRY
Well, I'm glad I brought it up.
New scene.

KRAMER
Got any shredded coconut?

JERRY (LOOKING AT KRAMER'S MOUSTACHE)
Uh, we're not doing that anymore.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah, right. (walks out)

GEORGE
Oh my god.

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.

JERRY
So what's this job?

GEORGE
Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports.

JERRY
Knicks? Rangers?

GEORGE
Playground equipment.

JERRY
Welcome back to the show.
Kramer walks back in, clean shaven.

KRAMER
Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?

JERRY
No.

GEORGE (HOLDING HIS CANE)
I gotta hobble. (walks out)
Kramer puts some aftershave on his lip.

KRAMER
D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving cream. I'm getting no protection.

JERRY
What kind do you use?

KRAMER
Whatever you get.

JERRY (NODS)
Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe.

KRAMER
Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.

JERRY
Remember David Puddy?

KRAMER
She's dating him again, huh?

JERRY
Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the
order.

KRAMER
Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. That guy's coming home in a body
bag.
New scene.
Atlas map of Scandinavia with Oslo, Norway highlighted. Cut to Elaine and Puddy

PUDDY
Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a twenty kroner.
No wait, that's another ten kroner. A fimty kroner? How much is that?

ELAINE
We have to break up.

PUDDY
What?

ELAINE
I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the
change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York
again, you are going home in a body bag!

PUDDY
Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has that's not
in The Gap on Broadway?

ELAINE
Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!

PUDDY
Fine!

ELAINE
Fine!

CAB DRIVER
Okay, terminal three. Have a nice flight.
New scene.
Interior of an airplane. Elaine and Puddy are seated together.

New scene.
Jerry's apartment. Kramer and Jerry are there.

KRAMER
Hey, what are you doing?

JERRY
Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a
men's room. That's the end of that.

KRAMER
Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he
killed.

JERRY
He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time
slot hit.

KRAMER
Well, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a stick of
Jerry's butter across his face) You're just being totally ridiculous. (keeps
rubbing) I'll see you later buddy.

JERRY
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

KRAMER
What?

JERRY
Do I have to ask?

KRAMER
I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy?
Kramer starts to walk out, Jerry grabs him by the shirttail and drags him back.

JERRY
Why are you buttering your face?

KRAMER
I'm shaving with it.

JERRY
Oh Moses smell the roses.

KRAMER
Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. Now feel
my face.

JERRY
No.

KRAMER
Feel it.

JERRY
I don't want to.

KRAMER
Feel it. Feel it.

JERRY (PLACES TWO SLICES OF BREAD AGAINST KRAMER'S FACE)
That is close.
Kramer takes the bread and eats it as he walks out of Jerry's apartment.
New scene.
George's job interview at Play Now Sporting Goods.

GEORGE
I got the job?

MR. THOMASSOULO
I don't want you to think that anyone's gonna treat you any
differently just because of your, uh, handicap.

GEORGE
Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) I'm not handicapped.

MR. THOMASSOULO
I'm sorry. Differently, uh, advantaged.

GEORGE
Yeah, I didn't mean that.

MR. THOMASSOULO
Of course you will have your own private, fully equipped
bathroom.

GEORGE
When do I start?

MR. THOMASSOULO
Whenever you feel that you're able. (Rises to show George
out) Um, you need a hand here.

GEORGE
Yeah, what the hell.
New scene.
Monk's. George and Jerry are in their regular booth.

JERRY
You got the job?

GEORGE
Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They treat me so
great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible
office, a great view.

JERRY
Hold on, they think you're handicapped?

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom
they gave me!

JERRY
How can you do this?

GEORGE
Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now
getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a
position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no
arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family,
drove a better car than I did.

JERRY
He drove a car with no arms?

GEORGE
Alright I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true. He
hated me anyway!

JERRY
Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?

GEORGE
I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a
gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building.
Kramer walks up holding an institutional sized container of butter.

KRAMER
They hooked me up.

GEORGE
What's with all the butter?

KRAMER
I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?

JERRY
You can eat it?

KRAMER
No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body.
Jerry smirks, Kramer walks away.

JERRY
Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna.

GEORGE
Who?

JERRY
The tooth brush in the toilet bowl.
Bania and Jenna walk over.

BANIA
Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good lookin' huh?

JENNA
Jerry's the guy that I dated right before you.

BANIA
Oh. This is awkward.

JENNA
Don't worry, Kenny. After dating Jerry, you're a pleasure.
Bania and Jenna leave.

JERRY
I don't believe this.

GEORGE
You miss her, don't you?

JERRY
No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything off me,
first laughs now ladies.

GEORGE
You miss her.
New scene.
Puddy and Elaine on the plane.

PUDDY (TO FLIGHT ATTENDANT)
You know I think ultimately, I'm upset with
myself. I knew what I was getting into, she's a bitter, unstable person. I
mean the sex was good. I'm sure it was fine for her. I need more.

ELAINE (TO ANOTHER PASSENGER)
Huh. You believing this?

PASSENGER (APOLOGETIC)
Excuse me, I was sleeping.

ELAINE
You missed quite a performance.
Elaine drinks from a can of juice.

PASSENGER (DISBELIEVING)

everyone, including the man he tripped.
New scene.
Jerry walks into his apartment sniffing the air, followed closely by Newman.

JERRY
Someone's cooking.

NEWMAN
Hello, Jerry.

JERRY
Hello, Newman.

NEWMAN
You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf between us and
I say, "Why?" Are we really so different. For what is--

JERRY (CUTTING IN)
I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman.

NEWMAN
Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's got something
on the griddle. maybe it's Kramer.

JERRY
No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter - pause - Oh
no!

NEWMAN
Butter?
New scene.
Back to the airplane. Elaine and Puddy indirectly attack each other.

PASSENGER (EXPLAINING THE COINS TO ELAINE)

ELAINE (TO PASSENGER)
You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner
comprehension problem. No what I mean? A real cement head.
Puddy and the woman across the aisle share a laugh.

WOMAN
David, you are so funny.

PUDDY
Yeah, I know.

ELAINE (GRABBING PUDDY)
What are you doing?

PUDDY
It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life.

ELAINE
By making time with some floozy across the aisle?

PUDDY
Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with you and, uh,
vegetable lasagna?

ELAINE
This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.

PASSENGER (HERETOFORE KNOWN AS VEGETABLE LASAGNA)
I can here you.

PUDDY
Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were up to me, we'd
still be together.

ELAINE
Well maybe I feel the same way.

PUDDY
Ok.

ELAINE
Ok, so now what?

PUDDY
Let's make out.
New scene.
Roof of Jerry and Kramer's building, very bright and sunny. Kramer is decked
out shirtless and sleeping on a lawn chair, and he's bright red.

JERRY
Kramer!

KRAMER
Oh, man. I think I cooked myself.

JERRY
Look at your skin.

KRAMER
Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done.
New scene.
Jerry's apartment, Kramer walks in.

KRAMER
I'm fried.

JERRY
Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for that?

KRAMER
Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.

JERRY
Is that what the doctor said?

KRAMER
No, I read an article in Bon Appetite magazine.
Kramer leaves, George enters, limping.

GEORGE (SNIFFING)
Hmm. Game hen?

JERRY
Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?

GEORGE
No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my
ankle.

JERRY
What happened?

GEORGE
Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --

JERRY
Oh no, not you too?

GEORGE
I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...

JERRY
You know what's good for that? Relish.
Phone rings, Jerry answers.

JERRY
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!!
Thank you. (Hangs up.) I don't believe this. They've added Bania to the
network showcase and he's going on right after me.

GEORGE
So what, he's got a couple of good jokes.

JERRY
Like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping
carts with one bad wheel?

GEORGE
That's true, that always happens to me.

JERRY
You think that's funny?

GEORGE
I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.

JERRY
You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!

GEORGE
maybe I am.

JERRY
Oh, I'm gonna puke.

GEORGE
Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) puke! Don't have to
think about that.
New scene.
Elaine and Puddy on the plane.

ELAINE
I can't believe we broke up like that.
Elaine starts reading, Puddy stares off into space.

ELAINE
Do you want something to read?

PUDDY
Nah.

ELAINE
Well, are you going to take a nap or --

PUDDY
Nah.

ELAINE
You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?

PUDDY
Yeah.
Elaine tries to read but cannot concentrate.

ELAINE
That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has
changed. We're back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had
12 hours ago.

PUDDY
Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back.

ELAINE
Please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, vegetable lasagna
here knows it.

VEGETABLE LASAGNA (APOLOGETICALLY)
I don't want to get involved.

ELAINE
Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram
right into it and end this whole thing!

VEGETABLE LASAGNA
Oh god.
Elaine then slams her seat back several times into the legs of the passenger
seated behind her.

PASSENGER
Ow! Ow!!
New scene.
Kramer's apartment, Kramer is in the hot tub, Newman is seated beside it,
reading "Alive"

NEWMAN
How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here.

KRAMER
Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.

NEWMAN
The smell. It's still with you, huh?

KRAMER
Yeah, it's baked on it. Put some butter in. Stir it up so it melts.
Newman stirs the hot tub with a lacrosse stick, licking his lips and working
himself up.

KRAMER
Ahh, now I'm simmering.
Newman drops the stick and runs out.

NEWMAN
I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
New scene.
George and Mr. Thomassoulo at Play Now.

MR. THOMASSOULO
Good morning, George. Is something wrong with your other leg?

GEORGE
Oh, no, that's just the old handicap acting up.

MR. THOMASSOULO
But your cane's on the wrong side.

GEORGE
That's just because we're standing on opposite sides. See, when we
met, I was over there and you were over here so the image was reversed, like in
the mirror.
They walk over to a mirrored wall.

GEORGE
See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?

MR. THOMASSOULO
Uh, yeah, I guess.

GEORGE (PASSES CANE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT AND BACK A FEW TIMES)
But, see here.
Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right. Right. Wrong--

MR. THOMASSOULO
Will you stop it, George? Just stop it! I think I can see
what's going on here.
New scene.
Jerry's apartment, there's a beeping sound coming from the hall. Jerry opens
the door, George rolls in on a Rascal scooter.

GEORGE
Well, you're not gonna believe what happened.

JERRY
You mugged Stephen Hawking?

GEORGE
Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal,
Jerry. On the house.
George rides around the apartment.

JERRY
Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at
no more than three miles an hour.
Jerry's phone rings, he answers it.

JERRY
Hello?

ELAINE
Jerry.

JERRY
Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going?

ELAINE
Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!

VEGETABLE LASAGNA
Please don't shout. I can't take it.

JERRY
Who's that?

ELAINE
It's Vegetable Lasagna.

JERRY
Who?

ELAINE
Vegetable Lasagna!

VEGETABLE LASAGNA
My name is Magnus.

ELAINE
Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!

JERRY
Get me some duty free Kahlua.
Jerry hangs up.

GEORGE
How's the trip?

JERRY
Sounded good.
George. Well. Gotta motor.

JERRY
Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase
tonight.

GEORGE
Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?

JERRY
That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off.

GEORGE
What are you talking about? You're not!

JERRY
That's right, I'm taking a dive.

GEORGE
You're throwing the set?

JERRY
I'm laying down! Then let's see how he does up there, without all the
assistance.

GEORGE
Listen Jerry. Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My
generation.

JERRY
We're four months apart.

GEORGE
nevertheless. His time has come.
George tries to back out but his front wheel becomes wedged under Jerry's coffee
table.

GEORGE
Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my
way.
Jerry ignores him, George leans on his horn.

Hee hee! Yeah yeah!

sweat. Kramer and Bania are there.

BANIA
Ouch.

KRAMER
You didn't do so bad.

JERRY
What are you talking about? I bombed!

KRAMER
No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? It was edgy, it was not
my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it.

JERRY
Like who?

KRAMER
Like that guy who yelled out.

JERRY
He had cancer!

KRAMER
And laughter is the best medicine.

JERRY
Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you.

CLUB ANNOUNCER (OC)
Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania!
Bania walks out, Jerry leaves, Newman walks in.

Turkey?

KRAMER
A big fat turkey.

NEWMAN
I'm sorry I missed that.

KRAMER
He worked so hard and then he just--
Kramer accidentally knocks over a bowl of oregano, getting it all over himself.

KRAMER
What is this, oregano?
Just then the other kitchen door swings open and a chef busts through carrying a
bowl of Parmesan cheese. he trips and empties the bowl all over Kramer.

KRAMER
Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and it's sticking
to me because of the butter! Look at me!
Newman, still salivating, now with a vacant stare, grabs a bunch of green leaves
and hands them to Kramer.

What is this, parsley?
Newman makes as if to attack Kramer.
New scene.

Are you a religious man, sir?

MR. THOMASSOULO

JAY
That thing you did having the two guys running through? I love stuff you
don't have to think too much about

STU
Give us a call. We want to be in the Kenny Bania business.

JAY
By the way, Jerry? The suspenders? A little hacky.

BANIA
How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now I'll have

George, you’re not really handicapped, are you?

GEORGE
I’ve had my difficulties.

THOMASSOULO
I saw you running down Amsterdam Avenue lifting that 200 pound motorized cart with one hand.

GEORGE
Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?

THOMASSOULO
No

GEORGE
How about the old Spider Man live action show?

THOMASSOULO
George, I’ve realized we’ve signed a one-year contract with you, but at this point I think it’s best that we both go our separate ways.

GEORGE
I don’t understand.

THOMASSOULO
We don’t like you. We want you to leave.

GEORGE
Clearer

(SCENE
At Monks Caf)

JERRY
So you’re staying at Play Now?

GEORGE
Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.

JERRY
But they not you aren’t handicapped, aren’t you ashamed?

GEORGE
They’re the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.
(Elaine walks in)

ELAINE
Hey

JERRY & GEORGE
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!

GEORGE
Hello-o-o-o Elaine!

ELAINE
What’s that?

JERRY
Oh, it’s just this stupid thing.

ELAINE
Well, I’m sure it’s stupid. It’s not about me, is it?

JERRY
(doing the voice) No-o-o-o.

GEORGE
(doing the voice) Not at all.

ELAINE
Tell me!

JERRY
All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?

ELAINE
Yeah.

JERRY
Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.

ELAINE
How is it talking?

JERRY
Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) I’m bored. Talk to me.

ELAINE
Oh I gotta start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.
(Puddy walks in)

JERRY
Hey, look whose here - Puddy.

ELAINE
My Puddy? But we broke up.

PUDDY
Hey Benes, How are you?

ELAINE
I’m doing great.

PUDDY
Great. (pauses) See ya.

JERRY
Well, that’s it. You two are back together.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.

ELAINE
David and I will not be getting back together.

JERRY
Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You can’t do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.

GEORGE
That’s beautiful.

ELAINE
What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.

JERRY
That’s different. I didn’t have feelings for those people. But you, you’ll backslide

ELAINE
You want to bet?

JERRY

So I’ll call you tonight?

JERRY
Yeah.

CLARE
What’s wrong with the belt?

JERRY
I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So…(throws away belt) that’s it!

CLARE
So, you’re insane?

JERRY
Oh yes, quite.
(Kramer walks in)

KRAMER
Hello!

JERRY
Of course it’s a sliding scale.

CLARE
Catch you later.

KRAMER & JERRY
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! (haha)

JERRY
(doing the voice) La la la.

KRAMER
(doing the voice) La la la.
(Kramer is reading the newspaper at the table)

KRAMER
Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.

JERRY
Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, that’s a good idea.

KRAMER
Of course it’s a good idea, it’s my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.

JERRY
Which part? The renovating the restaurant you don’t own part or spending the two hundred million you don’t have part?

KRAMER
You see I come up with these things, I know they’re gold, but nothing happens. You know why?

JERRY
No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.

KRAMER
(interrupts) No, no…time! It’s all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?

JERRY
I can ball park it.
(Elaine walks in – how did she come up without the buzzer?)

ELAINE
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!

KRAMER
Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!

JERRY
Hey, I called you last night, where were you?

ELAINE
(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.

JERRY
George?

ELAINE
(looking guiltier) No, no…no.

JERRY
Well, I was here, that’s everyone (laughing).

ELAINE
(laughing).

JERRY
Are those the same shoes as yesterday?

ELAINE
Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.

JERRY
Your hair, it’s somewhat de-poofed.

ELAINE
It’s the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?

JERRY
Wait a second, what’s going on here?

ELAINE
Nothing, nothing.

JERRY
(screams).

ELAINE
(screams).

JERRY
You’re wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!

KRAMER
Hoochie moochie. (haha)

JERRY
Hand it over. Pay up.

ELAINE
No! It’s an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!

JERRY
Then what do you call it? People don’t just bump into each other and have sex. This isn’t cinemax.

ELAINE
It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.

JERRY
Ah, dinner! That’s it, you’re all the way back!

ELAINE
Ugh!

JERRY
Sex, that’s meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; that’s heavy. That’s like an hour.

KRAMER
(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!

(SCENE
At Play Now)

GEORGE
Good Morning!

CO-WORKER
Go to hell!

GEORGE
Hi Allison, that’s a nice dress.

ALLISON
Don’t even look at me.

GEORGE
Hey Glenn!

GLENN
Hey, go tell hell!

GEORGE
Heard that one already.

(SCENE
At Jerry’s apartment)
(Jerry walks in. Kramer is showing his "intern," Darren around)

KRAMER
…So that’s the bedroom. Here’s the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchen…Yeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.

JERRY
And you are?

DARREN
Oh, hey, I’m Darren. I’m new here.

KRAMER
Yeah, that’s Jerry, you don’t have to worry about him. Why don’t you go across the hall and get started on that mail.

DARREN
Right!

KRAMER
He’s a go getter!

JERRY
Who’s he?

KRAMER
My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.

JERRY
Alright.

KRAMER
Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.

JERRY
But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.

KRAMER
Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.

JERRY
Alright, it’s time to go.

KRAMER
Jerry, it’s not for people, it’s for oil tankers.

JERRY
(sarcastically) I know!
(Jerry tries to shove Kramer out the door)

KRAMER
You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil won’t spill out.

JERRY
Actually, that is not a bad idea.

KRAMER
(smiles) yeah.

JERRY
Now, it’s time to go.
(slams door)
(phone rings)

JERRY
Hello

GEORGE
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (He’s sitting on the floor in his Play Now office).

JERRY
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, what’s going on?

GEORGE
Siege mentality Jerry. They really want me out of here. They’ve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. I’m like Hitler’s last days here.

JERRY
So, are you going to leave?

GEORGE
Oh no! I’m vigilant. They’ll never get me out. I’m like a weed, Jerry.

JERRY
I thought you’re like Hitler in the bunker?

GEORGE
I’m a weed in Hitler’s bunker.

JERRY
I’m getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) I’m getting another call, see ya…(answers call) Hello!

DARREN
Hi, this is Darren from Kramer’s office. Mr. Kramer would like to schedule a lunch with you at Monk’s coffee shop.

JERRY
(looking shocked) Really? When?

DARREN
In 10 minutes. Do you need directions?

JERRY
No, I don’t.

DARREN
Well, I’ll call back in 5 minutes to confirm.

KRAMER
Yeah, 5.
(Elaine walks in – again, how did she get up without the buzzer?)

ELAINE
Hey!

JERRY
Hey! So, where’s my money?

ELAINE
No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?

JERRY
Oh yeah, hold on.
(Jerry calls Kramer and Darren answers)

JERRY
Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerry’s office. (Elaine is looking confused). We’re going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean he’s already left?
(Kramer walks in)

JERRY
Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?

KRAMER
What? When did this happen?

JERRY
Well, just…

KRAMER
(yelling) DARREN!

(SCENE
At Elaine’s apartment)
(Sitting on the couch thinking to herself)

ELAINE
I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddy’s. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. I’ll call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. That’s funny. That’s really funny. That’s really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).

(SCENE
At Monk’s Cafe)

GEORGE
Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.

JERRY
Do you have to write all this stuff down.

DARREN
Well, Mr. Kramer is in a meeting with Mr. Lohmase and he didn’t want to miss anything.

JERRY
So, how hot did it get?

GEORGE
I don’t know, 120, 130…Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.

JERRY
I guess you can take anything, but actual work.

GEORGE
Bring it on!
(Kramer walks in)

GEORGE
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o Kramer!

JERRY
(doing the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!

GEORGE
(doing the voice) La la la.

KRAMER
Sorry I couldn’t get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his "intern")

DARREN
Well, after ordering, Mr. Seinfeld and Mr. Costanza debated on whether or not iron man wore some sort under garment between his skin and his iron suit…

KRAMER
Uh huh…

GEORGE
(Interrupts) And I still say he’s naked under there!

JERRY
Oh that makes a lot of sense.

GEORGE
Oh, shut up!

DARREN
…Then Mr. Seinfeld went to the restroom, at which point Mr. Costanza scooped ice out of Mr. Seinfeld’s drink with his bare hands using it to wash up (Jerry is taking a sip of water and looking mad) then Mr. Costanza remarked to me, "This never happened." (Jerry then spits out the water).
(George is looking pissed off)

(SCENE
At Jerry’s apartment in his bed)

JERRY
(giggling)

CLARE
What’s so funny?

JERRY
Oh, nothing. (still giggling)

CLARE
What are you laughing about? Tell me.

JERRY
Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. We’ve been doing this silly, dumb voice.
(Clare storms out of the room mad!)

CLARE
So is it fun humiliating me?

JERRY
No, it’s not you. It’s your stomach, he’s taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.

CLARE
So you think I’m fat?

JERRY
No it’s…
(Darren walks in)

DARREN
Mr. Kramer says, "hey buddy!"

JERRY
Hey, we’re kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?

DARREN
Oh yeah sure, sure. Should we set something up now?

JERRY
(Screams) GET OUT!

CLARE
I’m leaving too.

JERRY
No body said you’re fat. He’s a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.

CLARE
He is fat!

JERRY
No, he’s just a little bloated.

CLARE
Good-bye!

JERRY
It’s mostly water weight.
(Kramer walks in)

KRAMER
Boysenberry, the kid is still learning.
(Darren is standing in the hallway on the phone)

DARREN
Mr. Kramer…Dean, my internship is on line two, she wants to set up a meeting.

KRAMER
Yeah, well nothing before noon.

JERRY
Line two?

KRAMER
Yeah, your phone is line one.

JERRY
Oh…

(SCENE
At Elaine’s apartment)

PUDDY
So the gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.

ELAINE
See, this is what Jerry’s doesn’t understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesn’t mean we are back together.

PUDDY
I mean I love just seeing you and having sex.

ELAINE
Yeah.

PUDDY
Not having to do all that…you know…work.

ELAINE
Well, either way…

PUDDY
All that calling you, and buying you stuff…

ELAINE
David…

PUDDY
Caring about how everyone at work isn’t as smart as you. It’s brutal.

ELAINE
Alright that’s it! We’re back together!

PUDDY
Oh, no.

ELAINE
Oh, yeah.

PUDDY
Look Elaine, be reasonable.
(Elaine kisses Puddy)

ELAINE
Get those clothes off. You’re going to spend the night and we’re going to cuddle.

PUDDY
What?

ELAINE
You heard me. Strip!

(SCENE
At Play Now)
(George is walking in the hallway to his office. He sees his office has been boarded up)

GEORGE
(whistling)….(laughing)….Alright……OK….
(George goes through air vent – in his office)

GEORGE
(on phone – calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? …Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) I’M IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.

(SCENE
At NYU)

KRAMER
Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?

DEAN JONES
I’ve been reviewing Darren’s internship journal. Doing laundry…

KRAMER
…Yeah.

DEAN JONES
…Mending chicken wire, hi-tea with a Mr. Newman.

KRAMER
I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but it’s business as usual at Kramerica.

DEAN JONES
As far as I can tell your entire enterprise is more than a solitary man with a messy apartment which may or may not contain a chicken.

KRAMER
And with Darren’s help, we’ll get that chicken.

DEAN JONES
I’m sorry, but we can’t allow Darren to continue working with you.

KRAMER
Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.

DEAN JONES
You fly is open.

(SCENE
At Jerry’s apartment)
(Jerry & Clare are talking by the doorway)

JERRY
So you’re sure you’re not still angry about last night?

CLARE
No, I’m fine. Just as long as you don’t ever do that voice again.

JERRY
Never?

CLARE
Never.

JERRY
What about if you’re not around?

CLARE
No!

JERRY
So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?

CLARE
That’s right.

JERRY
I can do that.

CLARE
So what’s your decision?

JERRY
I don’t know.
(At the dock or beach)
(Jerry is thinking to himself – looking quite funny)
(He’s thinking about all the times him and Clare spent together. He’s trying to decide if he likes her more or the voice more)
(Jerry knocks on Clare’s door)

CLARE
Jerry…HI.

JERRY
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. (haha)

(SCENE
At Jerry’s apartment)

GEORGE
You broke up with her? Why?

JERRY
So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. What’s the matter?

GEORGE
I think I’m getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?

JERRY
No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.

GEORGE
I think I like the girl better than the voice.

JERRY
Really?
(Elaine walks in – how does she keep getting up without that buzzer?!)

JERRY
(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.

ELAINE
Still?

GEORGE
I told you.

ELAINE
Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money).

JERRY
See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.

ELAINE
Yeah, well not for long. I’m breaking up with him.

JERRY
No, I don’t think so. I’ve seen you two together. You make each other miserable. It’s kismet.

ELAINE
Double or nothing.

JERRY
Done.

GEORGE
(talking from bathroom) Witness?

JERRY
You’re in there again.

GEORGE
I think Play Now is putting something in my food.
(Kramer walks in)

ELAINE
Alright, I’m out of here.

JERRY
What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesn’t fit him).

KRAMER
I don’t know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I haven’t been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. I’m clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?

JERRY
Yeah. Nine o’clock.

KRAMER
I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.

JERRY
(doing the voice) Good-bye Kramer.

KRAMER
Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.

JERRY
Really?

KRAMER
So played.

GEORGE
I told you.

(SCENE
Hallway, Darren is knocking on Kramer’s door)

KRAMER
Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.

DARREN
I don’t care about the internship. I care about Kramerica.

KRAMER
Kramerica is no more.

DARREN
What about the oil tanker bladder system? We were going to put an end to maritime oil spills.

KRAMER
Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.
(Kramer slams door)
(Kramer opens door)

KRAMER
Well, you’re still here?

DARREN
I haven’t had time to leave.

KRAMER
Well, I haven’t changed my mind.
(Kramer slams door)
(Kramer opens door)

KRAMER
Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, I’ll do it. Kramerica industries lives! Let’s get back to work!
(Kramer slams door)
(Kramer opens door)

KRAMER
Let’s see what Jerry has to eat.

(SCENE
At Play Now – in the bosses office)

THOMASSOULO
You win George. We’ve had it. If you leave right now, Play Now will give you six months pay. That’s half of your entire contract. Please…just go.

GEORGE
You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.

THOMASSOULO
Want to play hand ball huh? Fine. (calls on intercom) Attention Play Now employees, George Costanza’s handicapped bathroom is now open on the sixteenth floor to all employees and their families.

GEORGE
Well played.

THOMASSOULO
I’ll see you in hell Costanza.

(SCENE
At Jerry’s apartment)

JERRY
(on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in – Jerry asks George) So we definitely don’t want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, we’re back together again, great. Bye bye.

(SCENE
Hallway – Kramer & Darren are pushing an oil tank.

KRAMER
Hey.

JERRY
Trouble down at the plant?

KRAMER
It’s a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.

GEORGE
You have to drink that whole thing?

KRAMER
No. No. No. It’s for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.

JERRY
I understand (not really understanding, lol).

GEORGE
Would a giant rubber ball work?

KRAMER
Conceivably.

GEORGE
Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why don’t we test your bladder system at my office?

JERRY
You’re not…

GEORGE
Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, there’s nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.

(SCENE
At Monk’s Cafe)

PUDDY
Hey, you want to split a root beer (I think that’s what he says)?

ELAINE
I don’t think so David, we’re through.

PUDDY
Oh…That’s a nice sweater (Elaine smiles).

(SCENE
At Elaine’s house – the two are in bed)

ELAINE
Whew that was a dozy.

(SCENE
At Jerry’s apartment)
(Elaine throws down money on the table).

JERRY
Go again?

ELAINE
Book it.

GEORGE
(again from bathroom) Witness.

(SCENE
At Elaine’s apartment)

ELAINE
David I know this hurts, but it’s the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like he’s going to still get some).

(SCENE
At Jerry’s apartment)
(Elaine is placing money on the table one by one)

JERRY
Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.

(SCENE
Jerry and Elaine at the movies)

ELAINE
I’m going to get some popcorn.

(SCENE
At Jerry’s apartment)
(Elaine hands Jerry money)

ELAINE
So, how did it end?

JERRY
They got away.

ELAINE
uh.

(SCENE
At Elaine’s apartment)

ELAINE
Listen David, I’ve got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?

(SCENE
At Play Now)
(Darren & Kramer are pushing the ball of oil – Jerry walks in)

JERRY
Hey.

KRAMER
Did you bring the video camera?

JERRY
Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, I’ll see ya.

GEORGE
Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.

JERRY
I can’t. I got to meet Clare.

KRAMER
You gave up the voice?

JERRY
Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.

KRAMER & GEORGE
No. No

JERRY
Darren?

DARREN
Sorry Mr. Seinfeld.

JERRY
Uh, bathroom.

GEORGE
Hey, use mine. I’ll let you in.

JERRY
I thought it was open to the public.

GEORGE
I uh, took care of that.
(Both go to the bathroom, which looks really nice)

JERRY
Wow! Zanadu. No wonder you’re putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I?

GEORGE
I insist. I’ll fix us a drink. (phone rings – who would that be?) I got it.
(Back to Kramer & Darren in George’s office)

KRAMER
Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day I’d be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I would’ve said you’re crazy… Now let’s push this giant ball of oil out the window.
(Back in the bathroom)

GEORGE
So, check out my view.

JERRY
Wow! Hey, there’s Clare. I better go down.

GEORGE
Hey, there’s Kramer & Darren.

JERRY
There’s the giant ball of oil. Clare’s right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!

CLARE
I don’t believe this. I am not looking up if you’re going to do that voice.

KRAMER
Bombs away (Uh oh).

JERRY
This is going to be a shame.
(SPLAT!)

GEORGE
Hello.

KRAMER
Well, that didn’t work. Hey, how about this…ketchup and mustard in the same bottle?

DARREN
Oh that sounds interesting sir.

KRAMER
Yeah.
(Police sirens – uh oh)

(SCENE
At Monk’s Caf)

JERRY
Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess you’re not going in anymore.

GEORGE
Yeah.

JERRY
So they’re not paying you your…

GEORGE
No.

JERRY
So you’re pretty much…

GEORGE
Yeah.

JERRY
What ever happened to Darren?

KRAMER
Darren is going away for a long long time.

JERRY
So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that… (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil…

GEORGE
(doing the voice) I’m slippery as an eel…

KRAMER
(doing the voice) La la la.

JERRY
I’m just so glad it’s back.

(SCENE
At Elaine’s apartment in bed with Puddy AGAIN)

ELAINE
See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.

PUDDY
Elaine: I want to break up.

ELAINE
Ah nuts!
End.
The Costanzas are driving in the car.

FRANK
I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward.

ESTELLE
That's as far as it goes.

FRANK
There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body weight.

ESTELLE
I pulled it. It doesn't go.

FRANK
If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't blame
the mechanism!

GEORGE
All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit
sideways.

FRANK
Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like an animal!
Serenity now! Serenity now!

GEORGE
What is that?

FRANK
Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure gets
too high, the man on the tape tells me to say, 'Serenity now!'

GEORGE
Are you supposed to yell it?

FRANK
The man on the tape wasn't specific.

GEORGE
What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?

ESTELLE
I told you to fix that thing.

FRANK
Serenity nowww!

PATTY
So I told Bobby and Lisa that we'd try the new Chinese Spanish
place La Caridad on Saturday.

JERRY
Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.

PATTY
Well I thought this would be more fun so I gave the tickets away.

JERRY
What? All right, fine.

PATTY
Are you mad at me?

JERRY
No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.

PATTY
You know... I've never seen you mad.

JERRY
I get peeved.

PATTY
Mad.

JERRY
Miffed.

PATTY
*Mad*.

JERRY
Irked?

PATTY
I'd like to see you get *really* mad.

GEORGE
Why does she want you to be mad?

JERRY
She says I suppress my emotions.

GEORGE
So what do you care what she thinks.

JERRY
Good body.

GEORGE
She probably gets that impression because you're cool.
You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.

JERRY
But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.

GEORGE
Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic
pitch. (Kramer enters)

KRAMER
Hey.

JERRY
Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food.
Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!

KRAMER
(Laughing) What is that, a new bit?

GEORGE
I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix
my father's screen door in Queens?

JERRY
Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.

KRAMER
I'll do it.

GEORGE
Really? You wanna come?

KRAMER
Yeah, I love going to the country.

ELAINE
Where are they goin'?

JERRY
Fix a screen door in Queens.

ELAINE
(Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday
night?

JERRY
Not goin' to the Knick game.

ELAINE
I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.

JERRY
You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You
should be able to buy a cheaper gift.

ELAINE
(Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible.

KRAMER
(Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen
door. (Takes picture) Perfect.

GEORGE
Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps
blowing the door off.

ESTELLE
I hate that old door. Throw it out!

FRANK
Serenity now!

KRAMER
It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked
hard for ya.

FRANK
Will you put her to rest for me?

KRAMER
Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door)

ESTELLE
(From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the
garage.

GEORGE
Dad, what's all this?

ESTELLE
(From other room) It's junk.

FRANK
My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. Shut up!

GEORGE
You're selling computers?

FRANK
Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It was
called The Net, with that girl from the bus. I did a little reading,
and I realize, it wasn't that farfetched.

GEORGE
Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and
IBM?

FRANK
Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son.

JERRY
Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!

PATTY
I think they have 1% over there.

JERRY
1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!

PATTY
OK, Jerry, enough. I'm not buying it.

JERRY
You're damn right you're not buying it!

PATTY
You shouldn't have to try. It's just being open.

JERRY
I'm open. There's just nothing in there.

PATTY
Sarcastically) Uh huh.

JERRY
Oh, you think I'm lying about this?

PATTY
I think you are.

JERRY
Well, I'm not.

PATTY
Yes, you are, liar.

JERRY
Oh, stop it.

PATTY
OK, liar.

JERRY
That's enough!

PATTY
Ooh, that was good.

JERRY
Really? It felt good.

ELAINE
Congratulations, Mr. Lippman.

LIPPMAN
Oh, Elaine. My boy's a man today. Can you believe it? He's
a man.

ELAINE
Oh, congratulations, Adam. (Adam zealously French-kisses
Elaine)

ADAM
I'm a man!

JERRY
Tongue?

ELAINE
Yeah.

GEORGE
Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.

JERRY
Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.

ELAINE
And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six
more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings)

JERRY
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to
stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you
should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class.

ELAINE
Where did that come from?

JERRY
Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?

ELAINE
No.

JERRY
Good.

GEORGE
All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's
garage, help him sell some computers.

JERRY
What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage
death match.

GEORGE
Kramer.

KRAMER
Yeah.

GEORGE
What-what are you doing?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a
little life in her yet.

JERRY
What do you need it for?

KRAMER
(Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see
how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

GEORGE
Morning, ma.

ESTELLE
(From another room ) You're late!

GEORGE
Morning, dad.

FRANK
I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is Mr.
Costanza, and I will refer to you as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun.

LLOYD
(Handing Frank coffee) Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar.

GEORGE
What is Lloyd Braun doing here?

FRANK
Your mother recommended him.

GEORGE
Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up
is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a
mental institution?

FRANK
I didn't read his resume.

BRAUN
(Ringing the sale bell) Another sale, Mr. Costanza. Chalk me up on
the big board.

GEORGE
(Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this?
Frank (Drawing a zero under George's name) This is your lagging. Good
work, Braun.
Estelle (From another room) Good for you, Lloyd!

ELAINE
So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology
accepted.

ADAM
I'm not apologizing. It was great. I told everyone.

ELAINE
Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and
tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.

ADAM
Are you free Friday night?

ELAINE
I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am
in my early... 20s.

ADAM
But I'm a man. The rabbi said so.

ELAINE
No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a
man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.

ADAM
Well, if I'm not a man, then this whole thing was a sham! First,
they said I was gonna get great gifts, and then, somebody gives me
Boggle. I renounce my religion!

LIPPMAN
Who wants cookies?

ADAM
As of this moment, I am no longer Jewish. I quit!

LIPPMAN
What?

ELAINE
(Eating) Walnuts, mmmmmm.

FRANK
You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, we're
having a little sales contest. The loser gets fired, the winner
gets a Waterpik.

ESTELLE
(From another room) You're not giving away our Waterpik!

FRANK
Serenity now!

GEORGE
You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!

FRANK
I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with Lloyd
Braun! (Lloyd rings his sale bell and smiles)

GEORGE
You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell
computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why
not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell)
Serenity now!

ELAINE
Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your
father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of
varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.

ADAM
(Storming out of the room) Well, that does me a lot of
good. 'Early 20s'!

ELAINE
Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.

LIPPMAN
So, that's the type of guy you're looking for?

ELAINE
Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts
making out with her)

PATTY
(Surveying Kramer's hall patio ) What is this?

JERRY
(Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer
home? Oh, hey.

KRAMER
(Spraying his flowers) Hello, neighbor.

JERRY
Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.

KRAMER
Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to.

JERRY
You barbecuing tonight?

KRAMER
(Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks.

JERRY
So, where do you want to eat tonight?

PATTY
How about La Caridad again?

JERRY
Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?

PATTY
Jerry, you've been yelling at me all afternoon.

JERRY
Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!

PATTY
Maybe I should just leave.

JERRY
'Maybe'!?

PATTY
Good-bye!

JERRY
Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer,
sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler)

KRAMER
Hey, buddy!

ELAINE
(Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!
Kramer (Getting the door slammed on him) Y'all come back reeeaall...

ELAINE
Did you and Patty just break up?

JERRY
Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about
it!

ELAINE
Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard
about this great place called La Caridad.

JERRY
That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also,
but I wasn't in the mood.

ELAINE
Whoa. What is the matter?

JERRY
It's Patty.

ELAINE
Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.

JERRY
(Crying) What--what is this salty discharge?

ELAINE
Oh my God. You're crying.

JERRY
This is horrible! I care!

JERRY
Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.

KRAMER
She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?

JERRY
I don't know what's happening to me.

KRAMER
Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come
with it. It's like Endora's box.

JERRY
That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)

GEORGE
Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's
apartment)

KRAMER
(Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I
warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house.
This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!

GEORGE
(hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in
the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.

JERRY
You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?

GEORGE
Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer!
Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.

JERRY
Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever
tell you how much I love you?

GEORGE
What?

JERRY
I love you, George. Come here.

GEORGE
I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what?
If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.

JERRY
Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.

KRAMER
Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back
for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see
you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your
sink?

JERRY
Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!

KRAMER
I love you, too, buddy, and George--

GEORGE
I don't want to hear it, Kramer!

KRAMER
Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this
water on full blast.

GEORGE
What signal? What-what signal?

KRAMER
I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'

GEORGE
If I do it, will you buy a computer?

KRAMER
On the signal, George. On the signal.

GEORGE
Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.

JERRY
I love you, Costanza.

GEORGE
Will you shut up?!

KRAMER
Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the
faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!

ELAINE
So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.

GEORGE
Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.

ELAINE
What?

GEORGE
It means a non-Jewish woman.

ELAINE
I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to
do with it?

GEORGE
You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of
meeting a woman that's not like their mother.

ELAINE
Oh, that's insane.

GEORGE
I'll tell you what's insane: the price that I could get you
on a new desktop computer.

ELAINE
I am not buying a computer from you.

GEORGE
There's porn.

ELAINE
(Pausing) Even so.

GEORGE
Damn it!

ELAINE
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that
you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason
you like me is because I'm a shiksa.

LIPPMAN
That's simply not true.

ELAINE
If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.

LIPPMAN
You are wrong. I'll prove it.

ELAINE
Oh, no. Don't!

LIPPMAN
I renounce Judaism!

ELAINE
Oy vey!

JERRY
What happened to you, pal?

KRAMER
Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They
ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.

JERRY
Are you all right?

KRAMER
Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.

JERRY
So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?
Kramer (Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts
right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!
Elaine (Entering Jerry's apartment) Hey, what happened to you?

KRAMER
Serenity! (He exits)

ELAINE
Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is
renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is
*with* you people? What are you looking at?

JERRY
Sit down, Elaine.

ELAINE
Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.

JERRY
I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.

ELAINE
Do you have an apple or anything?

JERRY
Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.

ELAINE
Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.

JERRY
Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...

ELAINE
Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!

JERRY
When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in
front of us!

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
Elaine...

GEORGE
(Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry,
I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I
store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all
back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's
wrong with your leg?

JERRY
I'm asking Elaine to marry me.
George (Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.

JERRY
Elaine?

ELAINE
Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman
right now.

JERRY
Lippman?
Elaine (Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh,
yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand.
Come on! Come on!

JERRY
Can I help you?

ELAINE
No. Stay! Stay. Stay.

FRANK
Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt!
George (using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay?
Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?

FRANK
Costanza, you're white hot!

PHONE
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and--

FRANK
Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both the

SAME
you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik!

ESTELLE
You're not gonna give away that water pik!

FRANK
You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now!

LLOYD
You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing
doesn't work. It just bottles up the anger, and eventually, you
blow.

GEORGE
What do you know? You were in the nut house.

LLOYD
What do you think put me there?

GEORGE
I heard they found a family in your freezer

LLOYD
Serenity now. Insanity later.

JERRY
(Entering the hallway to his apartment) What happened here,
Kramer?

KRAMER
Serenity now, serenity now...

JERRY
Kramer!

KRAMER
Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children,
they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.

JERRY
You don't look well.

KRAMER
Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the
world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.

JERRY
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.
Kramer (going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about
it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment.
Serenity nooooooooww!

GEORGE
Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!

KRAMER
(crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!

GEORGE
Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?

KRAMER
(Crashing and banging around) Serenity nooooowwwww!

GEORGE
Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls
to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five*
computers?

KRAMER
(Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.

JERRY
He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?

GEORGE
Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle
it.

JERRY
George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done.
Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making
shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?

GEORGE
All right... here goes...

ELAINE
Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this
Shiks-appeal?

RABBI
Ha! Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the Yeti, or his North
American cousin, the Sasquatch.

ELAINE
Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied
Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.

RABBI
Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish
religion. For example, did you know that rabbis are allowed to date?

ELAINE
(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?

RABBI
You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in Myrtle
Beach. Perhaps, if you're not too busy, we could wing on down after
the High Holidays? Elaine? 'Lainie?

GEORGE
So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm
capable of. That's me.

JERRY
Yikes. Well, good luck with all that.

GEORGE
Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a
little compassion.

JERRY
I think you scared me straight.

ELAINE
All right, Jerome, I'm in.

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is
right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.

JERRY
I tell ya, I don't see it happening.

ELAINE
What? What happened to the new Jerry?

JERRY
He doesn't work here anymore.

ELAINE
Oh, well that's just *great!*

GEORGE
I love you, Jerry.
Jerry (Leaving) Right back at ya, Slick.

GEORGE
You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the
two of you get back together.

ELAINE
Well, that's because you're an idiot.

FRANK
You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink of
bankruptcy.

GEORGE
Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?

FRANK
He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked ringing
that bell.

ESTELLE
I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my car
in!

FRANK
This is a place of business. I told you never to come in here.
Serenity now!

ESTELLE
All right...

GEORGE
Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.

FRANK
So, what am I supposed to say?

GEORGE
'Hoochie mama'?

ESTELLE
Move your crap, I'm comin' in!

FRANK
No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!
End.
[Jerry's Apartment, 5A. Morty and Helen are packing suitcases.]

JERRY
Are you sure you can't stay longer?

MORTY
No, we just came for the funeral. `

HELEN
Poor Marvin Kessler, he went too early.

JERRY
He was 96 years old.

MORTY
That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape.

HELEN
That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block three times a week.

MORTY
And every morning I eat a plum.

JERRY
Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.

HELEN
What about you?

MORTY
Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.

JERRY
Really?
[Kramer comes in]

KRAMER
Hey, Seinfelds!

MORTY
Hey, Mr. Kramer!

KRAMER
How long are you staying?

HELEN
We just came down for a funeral.

KRAMER
Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...

HELEN
See you downstairs with the car.

JERRY
Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?

MORTY
No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here.
[Morty and Helen leave. Kramer pulls out a band aid from his arm.]

JERRY
Did you give blood?

KRAMER
No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.

JERRY
In case of what?

KRAMER
Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.

JERRY
Are we finished?

KRAMER
Done.
[Elaine is visiting her friend Vivian.]

VIVIAN
Elaine, I'm so glad you came out.

ELAINE
Yeah...

VIVIAN
You haven't seen Jimmy for years.

ELAINE
I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.

VIVIAN
Actually, I'm gonna need someone to look after him tomorrow evening.

ELAINE
Tomorrow evening, sure.

VIVIAN
Do you know anyone responsible?

ELAINE
Do I know anyone??

VIVIAN
Well, if you think of anybody, give me a call.
[George is with his girlfriend Tara. She is lighting a candle.]

GEORGE
What are you doing?

TARA
Incense, for the mood.

GEORGE
Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.
[Takes of his shoes and smells the candle.]

GEORGE
Um, cream soda?

TARA
Vanilla.
[Monk's Cafe. Jerry and Elaine.]

ELAINE
Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?

JERRY
Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is: who's responsible for this?

ELAINE
I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.
[George comes to the table and starts eating Jerry's fries.]

JERRY
What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?

GEORGE
I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!

ELAINE
You just left? What did you tell her?

GEORGE
I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
I don't know, I was starving Jerry!
[Waitress bring pudding to George.]

GEORGE
Oh, pudding! You want some?

JERRY
Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?

GEORGE
What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.

JERRY
Elaine, what do you think?

ELAINE
I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.
[Kramer is at the County Blood Bank.]

KRAMER
My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.

BANK EMPLOYEE
Well, we can transfer to another bank for you.

KRAMER
Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!
[George and Tara.]

GEORGE
So eh, what do you say?

TARA
I guess we could use some food in our lovemaking.

GEORGE
Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...

TARA
Wait wait wait, pastrami on rye with mustard?

GEORGE
Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9 weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?

TARA
No.

GEORGE
Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!
[George takes a big bite and charges on to Tara.]
[Monk's Cafe, Jerry and George.]

JERRY
Didn't go for it, huh?

GEORGE
No.

JERRY
So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?

GEORGE
She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.

JERRY
Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.

GEORGE
Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.

JERRY
Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.

GEORGE
Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.

JERRY
I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.

GEORGE
Well, I guess these would be out of the question. [pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.]

JERRY
What the hell is that?

GEORGE
Pudding skin singles.
[5A, Kramer and Jerry.]

KRAMER
Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware.

JERRY
Oh, why?

KRAMER
I closed down my account at the blood bank.

JERRY
What, it...it's here in the building?

KRAMER
Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?

JERRY
No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.

KRAMER
You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.
[Elaine comes in.]

ELAINE
Hey, working out?

JERRY
You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
[Kramer looks to the fridge.]

KRAMER
What the heck is going on here?

JERRY
Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.

KRAMER
Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.

ELAINE
Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.

JERRY
Is this about me?

ELAINE
No.

JERRY
Oh, then I lost interest.
[Elaine calls on the phone.]

ELAINE
Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...[hands the phone to Kramer.]

KRAMER
For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. [puts the phone down] Well, somebody's baby-sitting.

ELAINE
You? I'm more responsible than you are!

KRAMER
Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.
[George is in bed with Tara. He reaches to the drawer for some sandwich.]

GEORGE
Oh, Tara!
[Kramer comes to the Vivian's house and bangs the screen door.]

KRAMER
Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.
[Elaine comes and taps him on the back.]

ELAINE
Kramer...

KRAMER
Don't take my money!

ELAINE
It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.

KRAMER
No, I'm the baby-sitter.

ELAINE
No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.
[Vivian comes to open the door and Elaine pushes Kramer off the porch.]

VIVIAN
Elaine? What are you doing here?

ELAINE
Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...[Kramer moans from the bushes] what's that, some raccoon or something...[hits Kramer with a broom.]

VIVIAN
Well, I guess this would be all right. Jimmy, you remember Elaine? She's gonna watch you tonight.

ELAINE
Hi Jimmy. [Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.] Ouch! [The screen door hits her in the head.]
[5A, Kramer and Jerry.]

JERRY
Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.

KRAMER
There was an incident.

JERRY
Oh no, where's the blood? [opens the fridge] It's in here isn't it?

KRAMER
Would you stop it.

JERRY
What is this?

KRAMER
It's Jell-O.

JERRY
What about this? This is blood isn't it?!

KRAMER
This is tomato juice, look...[drinks from the bottle.]

JERRY
Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!!

KRAMER
Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.

JERRY
Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding?

KRAMER
Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.

JERRY
Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...
[Jerry hits a spatula on the table and one Exacto knife flies through the air.]

KRAMER
Heads up!

JERRY
Aaah...
[Elaine is on the baby-sitting gig and Jimmy is shooting her with a toy gun.]

JIMMY
You're dead, president Lincoln! You're dead!

ELAINE
I wish I was dead.

JIMMY
Can I have your juice?

ELAINE
As long as you don't put...
[Jimmy pours the juice to Elaine's bag.]

ELAINE
Thanks for the re-fill.
[Jimmy runs laughing from the room and Vivian comes in.]

VIVIAN
Hey, Elaine! How did it go?

ELAINE
Oh, he's...he's a joy...

VIVIAN
Really? Some sitter have told me he's bit of a handful.

ELAINE
Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.

VIVIAN
Oh Elaine, that's so good to hear. I've been having a few health problems lately.

ELAINE
It's not serious, is it?

VIVIAN
Well, it might be. Just in case anything does happen, it's nice to know there's somebody like you around.

ELAINE
Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. [Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.]
[Jerry wakes up at the hospital. Kramer is staring at him up close.]

JERRY
Aah!

KRAMER
It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here.

JERRY
I can see that! What happened?

KRAMER
That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.

JERRY
I'll remember that.

KRAMER
Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.

JERRY
What?

KRAMER
Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.
[Jerry starts screaming and Kramer joins him.]
[Monk's Cafe. Jerry and George.]

GEORGE
Three pints of Kramer's blood?

JERRY
I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.

GEORGE
Well, so much for purification week.

JERRY
So, how's the fornicating gourmet?

GEORGE
Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.

JERRY
George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
[Elaine comes in.]

ELAINE
Hey.

JERRY
Hey, how was baby-sitting?

ELAINE
Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.

JERRY
Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.

ELAINE
It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.

GEORGE
She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.

JERRY
Really?
[5A, Kramer and Jerry.]

KRAMER
Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?

JERRY
I'm not touching that thing.

KRAMER
Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.

JERRY
Oh, no...

KRAMER
What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, [takes Jerry hand] hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...

JERRY
Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.

KRAMER
So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!

JERRY
All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.

KRAMER
No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?
[Kramer leaves. Jerry phone rings and he answers.]

JERRY
Hello?
[It's Helen and Morty.]

HELEN
Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital.

JERRY
Kramer called you?

HELEN
He calls every week. Are you all right?

JERRY
Yes, I'm fine.

HELEN
He says he's fine.

MORTY
Tell him to eat a plum.

HELEN
Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought you some session with a personal trainer.

JERRY
I don't need a personal trainer. [Kramer comes in] all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.

MORTY
Plum...[Jerry hangs up.]

JERRY
Why are you calling my parents?

KRAMER
Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?

JERRY
Why here?

KRAMER
Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.

JERRY
Ok...

KRAMER
Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?

JERRY
Fine...

KRAMER
Ok!
[Newman runs in with two boxes of popcorn.]

JERRY
No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!

KRAMER
Blood!

JERRY
All right.
[Knock on the door. Jerry opens and it's Izzy Mandelbaum.]

IZZY
Hello, dough boy.

JERRY
Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer?

IZZY
I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need one. It's go-time.
[Elaine is on another baby-sitting gig at Vivian's. Vivian comes in and Elaine is sleeping on the couch, smoking a cigar.]

VIVIAN
Elaine? Elaine?

ELAINE
Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.

VIVIAN
Where's Jimmy?

ELAINE
I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.

VIVIAN
Sleeping like an angel. Elaine, you're the best.

ELAINE
No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!

VIVIAN
Be quiet. So, will you watch Jimmy tomorrow?

ELAINE
All right, but I'm running out of purses here. [takes her purse from a punch ball.]
[The Gladiator Gym. Jerry and Mr. Mandelbaum.]

JERRY
Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?

IZZY
Drop your purse, and pick up that medicine ball.

JERRY
Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?

IZZY
Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready?

JERRY
For what?

IZZY
All aboard in the pain train!
[Izzy starts hitting Jerry's stomach with weak taps.]

JERRY
How many session did my parents paid for?

IZZY
Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil.
[George and Tara are in bed. George reaches out for a sandwich]

GEORGE
Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight!

TARA
Oh, George!

GEORGE
And now for the trifecta. [Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.]

TARA
George? George? What are you doing?! [Pulls the covers off. George is eating a sandwich and watching TV.]

GEORGE
Pleasuring you?

[5A. KRAMER AND NEWMAN ARE MAKING SAUSAGES. TAPE RECORDER PLAYS JACKIE DAVIS
Manana. Jerry comes in.]

JERRY
What is this?

KRAMER
We're making sausages.
[Jerry stops the tape.]

JERRY
I thought you were gonna watch a video.

KRAMER
Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.

JERRY
Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.

KRAMER
All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.
[Kramer starts the tape again and he and Newman leave.]

JERRY
Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.
[Izzy Mandelbaum comes in with a plywood plate.]

IZZY
Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae. [Looks at the sausages] What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet?

JERRY
No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...

IZZY
Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch.
[Monk's Cafe. Jerry and George.]

JERRY
So, the free love buffet is over?

GEORGE
I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.

JERRY
Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.
[George eats a sandwich and gets flustered.]

JERRY
What's going on?

GEORGE
I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.

JERRY
Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.

GEORGE
I think you're right. You gonna eat that?

JERRY
No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
[Elaine comes in]

ELAINE
Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.

GEORGE
These fries are really really good...

JERRY
All right, that's enough of that. [Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.]

ELAINE
I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.

GEORGE
Uuh, sleepy.

ELAINE
No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.

JERRY
Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.

ELAINE
Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.
[Kramer comes in.]

KRAMER
Why did you get rid of that sausage?

JERRY
It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.

KRAMER
Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?

JERRY
What's wrong with yours?

KRAMER
I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.

JERRY
All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!

KRAMER
All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.
[Jerry's car. Kramer is taking the blood to the bank. Manaja song is playing.] 
[Kramer looks at the car's thermometer and it gets on hot.]

KRAMER
Oh, man...[looks to the glove compartment for a manual.] "If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner". Never, I can't do that.
[Engine begins to smoke.]

KRAMER
Oh, mama...
[Kramer stops and opens the hood.]

KRAMER
Shees, come on...[opens the radiator]..this thing is bone dry. [Looks at the blood.]
[Elaine is visiting Vivian.]

ELAINE
Vivian...

VIVIAN
Elaine!

ELAINE
Hi! This is my friend George.

VIVIAN
Hi...

ELAINE
I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.

VIVIAN
Ok.

ELAINE WHISPERS TO GEORGE
You're up.

VIVIAN
Oh, isn't Elaine fantastic?

GEORGE
Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.

VIVIAN
Really, why?

GEORGE
Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.

VIVIAN
Her grandparent passed away five years ago.

GEORGE
Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.

VIVIAN
She's American citizen, I have seen her passport.

GEORGE
All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.

VIVIAN
I haven't heard anything about another Biosphere.

GEORGE
That's because it's underwater.

VIVIAN
This is insane.

GEORGE
Is it?

VIVIAN
Yes it it.

GEORGE
Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.
[Oven pings]

VIVIAN
You...very knowledgeable.

GEORGE
Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?

VIVIAN
Yes it is. I find the pastrami to be the most sensual of all the salted cured meats. Hungry?

GEORGE
Very.
[They kiss and fall down to the floor.]

VIVIAN
Oh, wait...[Vivian turns the TV on.] Oohh...

GEORGE
Vivian!!
[Jerry's has belt and it's connected to the car with a rope. Izzy and Izzy Jr. are in the car.]

JERRY
Is this really necessary?

IZZY
If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a piece of meat.

JERRY
What if I can't keep up?

IZZY
You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son.

IZZY JR.
Right dad, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...

IZZY AND IZZY JR
Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...[Izzy Jr. drives ahead, but the car starts jerking]

IZZY
Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it!

JERRY
What's going on?

IZZY JR.
There's something wrong with your car. It's dripping something on my feet. Some kind of red liquid.

JERRY
Oh my God, the blood!

IZZY JR.
Blood!!
[Izzy Jr. floors the gas pedal and Jerry falls down.]

IZZY
Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is for real, you've got to want it...
[Jerry and Elaine in a hospital.]

ELAINE
So how long did they drag you?

JERRY
Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
[George and Jimmy come in]

ELAINE
Hi George. Hi Jimmy.

GEORGE
Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.
[Jimmy kicks George in to the shin.]

GEORGE
Ouch!

JERRY
What's the kid doing here?

GEORGE
I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.

JERRY
Oh, that's a drag...
[Kramer comes in.]

KRAMER
That kid...

JERRY
You put blood in the car?!

KRAMER
Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.

JERRY
Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.

KRAMER
You didn't get the blood from me.

JERRY
Then who?
[Newman comes in and he has band aid in his arm.]

NEWMAN
Hello Jerry.

JERRY
Aaaaahhh...!!!

GEORGE
So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!

ELAINE
(Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.

GEORGE
(Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.

JERRY
(Sarcastic) Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.

GEORGE
Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!
(Kramer comes in and sits down at the booth with them)

JERRY
(To George) I said I was sorry.

GEORGE
You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!

JERRY
(Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!

KRAMER
(Confused) What's up with you two?

GEORGE
I don't want to talk about it.

KRAMER
(To Jerry) So how was the big trip?

JERRY
I don't want to talk about it!

KRAMER
(Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened to your nose?

ELAINE
I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about')

KRAMER
Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?

ELAINE
She.. was.

JERRY
'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.

KRAMER
(Interested) Ooohh.. That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and heads for the bathroom)

GEORGE
(While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.

JERRY
I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!

(Cutting him off. To Elaine) Elaine, you were my maid of honor and you slept with MY Pinter?!

ELAINE
No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.

SUE ELLEN
I have never been so humiliated!

ELAINE
(To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all yoru fault!

GEORGE
(While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!

JERRY
(Pleading) George, I'm sorry..

GEORGE
You can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!

JERRY
(Confused) I don't know what that means.

GEORGE
(To his girlfriend) Alright, Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?

NINA
(Casually) Alright.. Neither.

GEORGE
What?! Well, what are you doing here?

NINA
A free trip to India. And by the way, you can take off those boots. Everyone knows you're five' six.

GEORGE
Five' eight! Five' seven!

ELAINE
(To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?

SUE ELLEN
No. (Grabbing at the stud in Elaine's nose) And take that stupid thing out of your nose!
(Elaine screams in pain as Sue Ellen pulls the stud out)

JERRY
That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!

Oh, you were pretty loaded.

ELAINE

JERRY
Oh. Hello, Tetanus.
(Scene cuts to Nina and George entering the wedding hall)

NINA
George, I've used the bathroom. It's fine.

GEORGE
(Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.

ELAINE
(Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking at his shoes) Are those Timberlands painted black?

GEORGE
(Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?

ELAINE
(Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks tward the bride and groom)

GEORGE
Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously angered at Jerry) I
believe you know Nina.

JERRY
(As George sits down) George, we need to talk.

GEORGE
(Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!

JERRY
Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.

GEORGE
(Outraged) "That's all"?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!

JERRY
(Pleading) I'm really sorry.

GEORGE
You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!

JERRY
(Confused) Where'd you get that one?

GEORGE
It's an expression.

ELAINE
(From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her head - apologizing)

GEORGE
(Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to
punish you!

JERRY
That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.

GEORGE
(Losing it) Funny guy!
(Elaine casually makes her way to Jerry and George)

ELAINE
Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!

GEORGE
Elaine, you have to sleep with me.

ELAINE
(Definite) I'm not gonna sleep with you.

GEORGE
Reparations!

ELAINE
Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with (Points to Jerry) him, he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all
ancient history.

GEORGE
(Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?!
(Everyone goes silent. George and Elaine both look sheepishly. All eyes on them, expecially Sue Ellen)

ELAINE
I can't tell you.

JERRY
(Handing her a small bottle) Here, drink this.

Okay. (Takes a drink) I slept with the groom.

Why don't you just make another wish?

KRAMER
And how am I gonna do that, Toots?

WOMAN
What about a shooting star?

KRAMER

For how long?

ELAINE
Three days.

GEORGE
Great. (Hugs Jerry) Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the best time with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with her already. You are a great friend. A
great, great friend.
(Kramer leaves his apartment, entering the hallway)

JERRY
(Trying to change the subject away from Nina) Hey, Kramer, what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on
in!

KRAMER
(Shrugging Jerry off) Nah.

ELAINE
You want to go to India?

KRAMER
I can't. (Complaining) I'm gonna drop dead.

GEORGE
Great! Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina..

JERRY

GEORGE
Why do you keep saying Nina?

ELAIEN
I don't know. Nina. Nina! (Feeling she's said to much, she goes to leave) I'm gonna go grab a bite.

NEWMAN
(To his new girlfriend) You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily cerified.
WOMAN; I could listed to you talk about mail all day.

KRAMER

KRAMER
Newman, wait!

NEWMAN
(Sputtering loudly) Kramer! I'm with people.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah. And thanks for inviting me!

NEWMAN
I did invite you.. Your invitation must've.. gotten lost in the mail.
(All postal workers burst out with laughter)

KRAMER
Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.

NEWMAN
(Refusing, Standing up) Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.

KRAMER
Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?

NEWMAN

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm..

ELAINE
.And it's so obvious that they don't want..

JERRY
Uh-huh..

ELAINE
.me to go.

JERRY
Sure.

ELAINE
So, the only reason..

JERRY
Uh-huh.

ELAINE
.she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.

JERRY
Uh-huh.

NINA
(From Jerry's room) Jerry?

JERRY
(To Elaine) Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get
some coffee.
(Nina enters the living room - sees Elaine)

NINA
Oh. Hi.

ELAINE
Hi.

NINA
(Getting ready to leave) Oh, I should.. um..

JERRY
Sure.

ELAINE
Bye.

NINA
Bye-bye. (Leaves)

ELAINE
(Gesturing back to the bedroom) Who else ya got back there?

JERRY
Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.

ELAINE
You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?

JERRY
Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.

ELAINE
Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.

JERRY
No good. Too many people know the combination.

ELAINE
(Confused) What combination? (Jerry makes the "drinky-drinky" sign with his hands) Don't be rediculous.
(Jerry opens one of his kitchen drawers)

JERRY
Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!

ELAINE
So what?

JERRY
And milk.
(Scene cuts to "THIRTY MINUTES EARLIER" Kramer is in Jerry's kitchen. He spills his milk and cereal on the counter)

USHA
You're not going to the wedding, are you?

ELAINE
Well..

USHA
Don't go. India is a dreadful, dreadful place.

ZUBIN
You know, it's the only country that still has the plague? I mean, the plague! Please!

USHA
Here's the registry. Send her a gift, and be glad you did not have to go.

ELAINE
(Soaking it in) Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.

ZUBIN
If I had to go to India, I wouldn't go to the bathroom the entire trip.

JERRY
Ah, just remember when you see him tomarrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.

NINA
Really?

JERRY
Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.

NINA
I know. You know, we never had a bad conversation.

JERRY
I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..

NINA
Heh.. yeah.

JERRY
Probably the reason..

"ONE DAY EARLIER" Kramer is standing outside FDR's door, talking to FDR. He is finishing what was once a large lollipop)

FDR
Are - are you dense? I said I wanted you to drop dead. Now.. drop dead! (Slams the door in Kramer's face)

KRAMER
(Walking away) I knew it.. Stupid Jerry..
(Scene cuts to "TEN MINUTES EARLIER" at Jerry's apartment. Jerry's at his door, talking with Kramer. Kramer's lollipop is slightly bigger)

JERRY
Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.

KRAMER
But you haven't seen..

JERRY
Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer)

KRAMER
Yeah.. (Heads for FDR's)
(Scene cuts to "TEN MINUTES EARLIER" at FDR's apartment. Kramer and FDR are talking at the door. Kramer's lollipop, of course, is larger than the scene
before)

FDR
That's right. My birthday wish was for you to drop dead.

KRAMER
Well, why?

FDR
(Sinister) I have my reasons.

KRAMER
Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.

FDR
That's just a silly superstition. (Slams his door on Kramer)
(Scene cuts to "TEN MINUTES EARLIER" Kramer comes into Jerry's apartment with a huge lollipop)

KRAMER
Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead.

GEORGE
FDR?

KRAMER
(To George) Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes telling the story) I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives
me this look..

GEORGE
(Guessing the look) Stink eye?

JERRY
(Also guessing) Crook eye?

KRAMER
(Entroducing yet another type of look to the boys) EVIL eye.

JERRY
Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday..

GEORGE
Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', "These are my friends?!"

JERRY
(Sarcasticly joking off what George said) Everyday is my birthday.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.
(Elaine opens the door, hitting Kramer)

ELAINE
Hi.
(Kramer, still wheezing from the door, leaves)

ELAINE
You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. An invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.

JERRY
(Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.

ELAINE
Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today.

JERRY
So you think it's a non-vite?

ELAINE
It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey, are you gettin' taller?

GEORGE
(Showing Elaine his boots) Timberlands.

ELAINE
Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..

JERRY
Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.

GEORGE
Jerry, would you make the call already?

ELAINE
What call?

JERRY
(Picks up the phone, dialing Nina) He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.

ELAINE
(Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation girl. (Somewhat bitter tward Jerry) The one you think can replace me?

JERRY
I was kidding when I said that!

GEORGE
(To Elaine) Told me the same thing.

JERRY
(On the phone) Nina, Hi. It's Jerry.

GEORGE
You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his head 'no') Perfect.

JERRY
(To Nina) Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?

GEORGE
(Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..

JERRY

GEORGE

JERRY
Hmm..

GEORGE
(Motioning tward waitress) I think she likes me.

JERRY
Sure.

GEORGE
So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?

JERRY
Are you?

GEORGE
Well, what's the reason?

JERRY
We were too compatible.. Our conversations were so engrossing.

GEORGE
How engrossing?

JERRY
If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.

GEORGE
Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya?
(Jerry snickers, then stares at George, smiling)

JERRY
Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the trasition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses.. I need an awkward pause.

GEORGE
I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wwear them every time I see her.

JERRY
Why?

GEORGE
In any othe shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!

JERRY
So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?

GEORGE
In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his meal) Hm.. tastes a little funky.

JERRY
Oh, I'm sure it's fine.

Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard.. and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, (Looks out the Monk's windows) there's my friend, FDR. I'm

KRAMER
Oh, hey, how you doing?

JERRY
Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.

KRAMER
Uh, no. Actually, it's Kramer.

JERRY
Oh.

KRAMER
Uh, you need any help, or..?

JERRY
No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?

KRAMER
Uh, no, no, no. I couldn't impose.

JERRY
Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life)

KRAMER
(Eyeing Jerry's empty apartment) Really?
End.
Jerry "Any
second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready."
Melissa "Oh, fantastic! I'm
starving."
Jerry "How about that."
Melissa "Mmm-hmm."

GEORGE
"She ate breakfast naked?"

JERRY
"She didn't even want a napkin."

GEORGE
"I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I
have never had living-room naked."

JERRY
"Oh, it's a scene."

GEORGE
"It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she
frolic?"

JERRY
"I don't really have enough room."
George "Yeah. Hey, Lainie,
Puddy."

ELAINE
"Hey!"

PUDDY
"Hi."

JERRY
"Hey."
Puddy "I got to make a pit stop."
Elaine "'Kay."

JERRY
"Back together?"

ELAINE
"His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it
another shot."

JERRY
"Ah..."

ELAINE
"So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke."

GEORGE
"'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?"

ELAINE
"He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago."

JERRY
"Why now?"

ELAINE
"A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to
apologize to anyone you've ever wronged."

GEORGE
"Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me."

JERRY
"Still with the neck hole?"

GEORGE
"Still upset. Very upset."

ELAINE
"What neck hole?"

GEORGE
"Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that
very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue."
Elaine "Faster."

GEORGE
"I asked if I could borrow a sweater."

JERRY
"A cashmere sweater."

GEORGE
"I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole
party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'"

ELAINE
"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"

GEORGE
"Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!"

ELAINE
"Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of
your neck?"

JERRY
"No, I think the head does most of the stretching."

GEORGE
"Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some
cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time."

ELAINE
"I really think it's the size of your neck."

GEORGE
"It's my head!"

ELAINE
"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"

ELAINE
"Hey."

PEGGY
"Hey."

ELAINE
"Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I
are the only ones who use this bathroom."
Peggy "Yeah. Great."
[Elaine is surprised to see Peggy get a seat protector for the toilet]

KRAMER
"You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to
hop in the shower."

JERRY
"That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?"

KRAMER
"Showering. How long does it take you?"

JERRY
"Ten minutes."
Kramer "Ten minutes? That's
kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?"

ELAINE
"Ten minutes."

KRAMER
"Let me smell you."

ELAINE
"All right. Whiff away."
Kramer "Uh... that's not bad at all."
Elaine "Hup! That's it."
Kramer "OK."

ELAINE
"So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy
using a seat protector."

JERRY
"So?"

ELAINE
"So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like
roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?"
Jerry, [seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda "I
think the damage is probably already done."
Jerry "All
right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene."
Elaine "Yeah, you're
probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks."

JERRY
"Mmm."

KRAMER
"Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get
wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!"
Jerry "Zephyr? That is not a
word."

MELISSA
"Do you challenge?"

JERRY
"No, I do not challenge."

MELISSA
"66 points. Ha ha."

JERRY
"I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the
tiles."

MELISSA
"You want some more ice tea?"

JERRY
"Sure."
Melissa, [coughing loudly "Wrong
pipe."
George "So she coughed."

JERRY
"Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, man."

GEORGE
"Everything goes with naked."

JERRY
"When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly
spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his
stomach in slow motion."

GEORGE
"Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I
expend just trying to picture women naked?"

JERRY
"But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad
naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke."

GEORGE
"All right. It's grovel time."

HANKE
"Hey, George. Jerry. Listen, I just got sober, so I've been going
through the Twelve Steps."

GEORGE
"What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?"

HANKE
"Yeah. Making amends."

GEORGE
"Important step. Maybe the most important."

HANKE
"Anyway, uh, Jerry, you know, this may sound dumb, but, you know, when
we first met I thought your name was Gary. And, I think I may even have
called you Gary a couple of times, and... I don't know if you noticed, but I
always felt bad about it, so, I'm sorry."

JERRY
"Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it."

HANKE
[eyeing George "Great. Great.
Well, I'll see you guys later."
Kramer "Well, I just got out of a 27-minute
shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I
think what I kept is even stronger now."
Jerry "You got some suds over here."
Kramer "Wha...? Oh, man!
Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing
wrong."

JERRY
"Oh, come on!"

KRAMER
"No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!"

JERRY
"You promise you'll never come in here again?"
Kramer "Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that."
Jerry "Now my sense of it is that you're probably
wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another."

KRAMER
"Well, that's how cats do it."

JERRY
"But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use
gravity."

KRAMER
"OK. Let's turn the water on now. "

JERRY
"No, I told you, it's just a dry run."
George "Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He
was spotted taking personal inventory."

JERRY
"That's Step Ten?"

GEORGE
"All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's
done. Do you believe this?"

KRAMER
"Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?"

JERRY
"You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer."

KRAMER
"Well, this has all been one big tease!"
Elaine "These
proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work."
Peggy "I'm... gonna
get another bottle of water."
Walter "Here, take mine.
There's a little left."
Peggy "Oh, thanks, Walter. Ahh!"
Hanke "Guys, there's no doubt that the pay
is good. But I don't just know if I see myself working with ice cream."

MAN #1
"You get pretty buff forearms."

HANKE
"I don't know if I'm into that."
George "Oh, hello, Hanke, others."

HANKE
"George."

GEORGE
"You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my
apology."

HANKE
"Apology? For what?"

GEORGE
"A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway
Metlife windbreaker?"

HANKE
"George, come on, not that neck hole thing."

GEORGE
"Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would
say you're sorry."

HANKE
"No way, you would've completely stretched it out."

GEORGE
"You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine."

HANKE
"All right, George, all right. I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry. I'm so
sorry that I didn't want your rather bulbous head struggling to find its way
through the normal-size neck hole of my finely knit sweater."
Kramer "Now see, that's smart.
Constant motion. Wow."
Man in Shower "Hey!"

KRAMER
"Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really
showing me something!"
Kramer "You got a
steak?"

JERRY
"What happened to you?"

KRAMER
"Ah, people in this city are crazy."
Jerry "Here ya go."
Kramer "Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you
got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak."

JERRY
"What?"

KRAMER
"Yeah, a different one."
Jerry "Oh!"

KRAMER
"Jerry!"
Melissa "OK, Jerry. I fixed that bike."

JERRY
"Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for
show."
Melissa "I should really clean those
bearings. Hold this. Look at all that gunk."

JERRY
"Please don't crouch."

MELISSA
"Ouch! Caught my skin."

JERRY
"Oh, that's bad. Especially that area."

MELISSA
"You got anything to snack on?"

JERRY
"Uhh..."
Melissa "Oh, pickles!
Unnhhhh! It's a tough one."

JERRY
"Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!"
Melissa "Unnnnh! Oooh. That's gonna leave a welt.
Look at that."
Jerry "I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too
much."

ELAINE
"Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so
offensive?"

PEGGY
"You seem to be with a lot of men."

ELAINE
"What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean,
we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or
there, but, wh-why is this your business?"

PEGGY
"It's not. Good day."
Elaine, [leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt,
sticking the stapler in her armpit "Oh. All
right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for
your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good,
isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy."

JERRY
"Well, technically he did apologize."

GEORGE
"Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was
riffing! Riffing! On my pain!"

JERRY
"So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original
apology?"

GEORGE
"That's right. I'm two in the hole!"

JERRY
"Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body
flex on a pickle jar."

GEORGE
"Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?"

JERRY
"Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?"

GEORGE
"Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that
belt sander?"

JERRY
"Yeah."
George "Well, you on all fours, that thing
vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!"
Jerry "Hello?"

KRAMER
"Hey, Jerry, guess where I'm calling from!"

JERRY
"World War I plane?"

KRAMER
"No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the
shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to
be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I
ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew."

JERRY
"When are ya gettin' out?"

KRAMER
"I'm not! I'll see ya later, buddy."

PETERMAN
"Bad news, people. Peggy is home sick."

ELAINE
"Oh, please."

PETERMAN
"She's stuffed up, achy, and suffering from intense malaise."

ELAINE
"Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?"

PETERMAN
"I just spoke with her, Elaine. She's in bed."

ELAINE
"Yeah this is all in her mind, OK? She is
insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed
her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a
wacko."
George "So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?"

SPONSOR
"Sponsor."

GEORGE
"Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy."

SPONSOR
"He's doing very well. He's already on to Step Ten."

GEORGE
"Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through
them pretty quick. You can get through six a day."

SPONSOR
"Is there some unresolved issue between you and Jason?"

GEORGE
"I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an
apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me."

SPONSOR
"I'm not sure what you want me to do."

GEORGE
"Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up!
When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause
I kept losing the Pinewood Derby."

SPONSOR
"You're quite upset, George."

GEORGE
"Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two."

SPONSOR
"Admit there's a higher power?"

GEORGE
"Yeah, let him chew on that for a while."

SPONER
"You know George, I think I can help you. We're having a meeting
tomorrow. Why don't you just come by?"

GEORGE
"All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much."
George "By the way, my
uncle was an alcoholic, so..."
Kramer "Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry
likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm
down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call
ya back."
Melissa "What are you doing?"
Jerry, [naked "I found a rough spot on the kitchen
floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here."

MELISSA
"No, not that. Why are you naked?"

JERRY
"I thought naked is good."
Melissa "This isn't good naked."
Sponsor "George, here, have a seat."
George "Where's Hanke?"
Sponsor "Shhhhh."

LEADER
"OK, let's get started. Welcome to Rage-aholics Anonymous."

GEORGE
"What? Rate-aholics?"

SPONSOR
"George, this can help you."

GEORGE
"Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge."

LEADER
"Excuse me. We have a 'no yelling' policy at these meetings."

GEORGE
"Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!"

LEADER
"Please don't call me 'Pinhead'."

GEORGE
"I'm losin' it!"
Jerry "He took you to Rage-aholics? Why?"

GEORGE
"Probably because this whole Universe is against me!"

JERRY
"You've got a little rage."

GEORGE
"I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!"

JERRY
"By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work."

GEORGE
"This bread has nuts in it!"
Jerry "Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with
my body?"

ELAINE
"Chicken wing shoulder blades."

JERRY
"That's it?"

ELAINE
"No, but that's one problem. Why?"

JERRY
"Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--"

ELAINE
"Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a
man."

GEORGE
"Why not? It's a good look for a woman."

ELAINE
"Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is
utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep."

JERRY
"So you don't think it's attractive?"

ELAINE
"It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian."

GEORGE
"Well, some women like it."

ELAINE
"Hmm. Sickies."
Kramer, [in the shower "Installing your

PUDDY
"This is Puddy."

KRAMER
"Well, this is Kramer."

PUDDY
"I know."

KRAMER
"Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage
disposal?"

PUDDY
"Well, it's a big job. You've got to dismantle the latch hasp from the
auxiliary drainage line."

KRAMER
"No. It says 'main line'."

PUDDY
"It's a misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?"

KRAMER
"Yeah."
Puddy "Hey, man, I'll call you back. I'll talk you
through it."

KRAMER
"Oh, OK. Well, thanks, buddy."

ELAINE
"Hey, Puddy."

PUDDY
"Hey, Babe, your boss called. You owe five bucks for a balloon
bouquet. Yeah, he says you can just give it to him tomorrow when you see him."

ELAINE
"Balloon bouquet? For who?"

PUDDY
"Peggy took a turn for the worst."

ELAINE
"Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?"

PUDDY
"That's what he said."

ELAINE
"I don't believe this woman."

PUDDY
"Talk to me, Babe."

ELAINE
"She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick."

PUDDY
"Oh, germ-o-phobe. I know what that's about."

ELAINE
"Huh?"
Puddy "I'm a recovering germ-o-phobe. Ten years."

ELAINE
"What is this symbol?"

PUDDY
"It's a germ."

PEGGY
"Elaine, it was very nice of you to bring the man you're currently
sleeping with over to talk to me, but I assure you, I don't have any problem
with germs."

PUDDY
"Don't you? Elaine."
[Elaine slowly creeps up towards Peggy]
Peggy "Please!"

PUDDY
"I know it looks bleak. I've been there. Ten years ago waking up in
bed next to a woman like this would've sent me running for the Phisohex."

PEGGY
"Really?"

PUDDY
"I still have trouble looking at those disgusting old bedroom slippers
she slogs around in."

ELAINE
"Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies."

PUDDY
"They're bacteria traps."

PEGGY
"So you... just learned to live with it?"

PUDDY
"For the most part."

ELAINE
"OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day."

JERRY
"So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is
better?"

MELISSA
"This is nice."

JERRY
"Yes, clothes. This is normal."

MELISSA
"Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? I was thinking that we could go
down..."
[as Melissa continues to talk, Jerry starts imagining her gorgeously naked,
and stops paying attention]

MELISSA
"Jerry? Jerry, are you listening to me?"

JERRY
"Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry."

MELISSA
"I wanted to know what you're doing tomorrow."

JERRY
"Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a..."
[as Jerry continues to talk, Melissa starts imagining him disgustingly,
'neanderthalishly' naked, and stops paying attention]
Kramer, [in the shower "So you broke up?"

JERRY
"We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her
naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked."

KRAMER
"Hang on."
[Kramer uses his shower garbage disposal to unclog the tub]

JERRY
"So what are you up to?"

KRAMER
"Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you
make those radish roses?"

JERRY
"Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom,
soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes."

KRAMER
"No problem there."
Hanke "George. Thanks for coming down to talk
to me. I wanted to see you right away, but my hours here aren't very
flexible. I just started yesterday."

GEORGE
"Well, I'm here. What is it?"

HANKE
"Well, I talked to my sponsor, and, uh, I've thought it over, and, you
know, my apology at the coffee shop was sarcastic, and rude, and you deserve
much better."
George "Well, thank you."

HANKE
"You're welcome."
Kid "Can I get a Triple Minute Man Mint?"

HANKE
"Waffle or sugar cone?"

GEORGE
"Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing
here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an
apology."

HANKE
"What?"

KID
"Can you get on that cone?"

HANKE
"Would you hang on just a second, son? George, what are you talking
about?"

GEORGE
"Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice.
It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology."

KID
"Is there anybody else here but you?"

HANKE
"I'm alone, and it's my second day. You know, I don't even think we
have that flavor so... George, really, enough, ok? You know, I-I admitted I
was wrong, so what more do you want from me?"

GEORGE
"I would like an apology."

HANKE
"All right, look, you know--"
Kid #2 "Did you try it?"

KID
"No, this guy doesn't know what he's doing."

HANKE
"Oh, yes I do. Yes, I do. OK? I'm interacting with someone here, if
you can understand that. Now, I'm sorry."

GEORGE
"Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it
again, and tell it to me."

HANKE
"I'm not saying anything to you. I'm not sorry. I was never sorry. It
was cashmere. I hate Step Nine! Where's that Rum Raisin? Where is it? Can't
find anything. I need a drink. Ah, daquiri ice. Here we go. What are you
looking at? Get out! Come on, can't you see we're closed?! Get out!"
Elaine, [eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine "Mmm. This food is
fantastic And what a pretty radish rose, huh?"

KRAMER
"Well, thank you."

ELAINE
"Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free."
[all four make toast]

KRAMER
"Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed
and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub."
[all four make another toast]

PEGGY
"You have a garbage disposal in your bathtub?"

KRAMER
"Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in
there."

ELAINE
"This food was in the shower with you?"

KRAMER
"Mm-hmm. I prepared it as I bathed."
[Peggy, Elaine, and Puddy all gag and wretch]

PUDDY
"Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!"

GEORGE
"Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics?"
Puddy "No, germ-o-phobes."

HANKE
"Please. Step Nine."

GEORGE
"That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would
stretch out the neck hole of his sweater."
[audience laughs]

GEORGE
"It wasn't funny."

HANKE
"It was a very nice sweater. Take a look at his neck, not to mention
the melon sitting on top of it. I don't know if I'd trust him with a v-neck."

This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.

GEORGE
I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)

ELAINE
Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.

JERRY
You have a standard fake?

ELAINE
Mm-hmm.

JERRY
(Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.

ELAINE
(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man
wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)

DENIM VEST
Hi!

JERRY
Hi, I'm Jerry.

WOMAN
Hi. JERRY: You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast.

Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.

JERRY
Didn't you call in sick yesterday?

GEORGE
Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing: "We don't care, and it shows."

JERRY
(Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?

GEORGE
Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) "Have you seen me?" (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next
envelope) Woah, something from Whatley.

JERRY
See? You give, and you get.

GEORGE
(Reading the card from Whatley) "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."?

JERRY
Oh, that's nice.

GEORGE
I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"

JERRY
To a children's charity!

GEORGE
Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!
(Elaine enters)

ELAINE
Hey!

JERRY
Hey.
(Waitress moves tward the table)

ELAINE
(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.

JERRY
"Atomic Sub"? Why are you eating there?

ELAINE
I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.

JERRY
What does that mean?

ELAINE
(Embarrassed) Free sub.
(George lets out a depressed sigh while reading a card)

ELAINE
What?

GEORGE
Nothing. It's a card from my dad.

ELAINE
What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?

GEORGE
It's nothing, stop it..

JERRY
When George was growing up..

GEORGE
(Interrupting) Jerry, No!

JERRY
His father..

GEORGE
No!

JERRY
Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.

ELAINE
Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.

GEORGE
(pleading) Alright..

JERRY
And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
(Elaine starts laughing uncontrollably - and continues to do so)

GEORGE
Jerry! Stop it!

JERRY
And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
(Jerry joins in with Elaine's laughter)

GEORGE
I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)

ELAINE
Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!

JERRY
So?

ELAINE
I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!

JERRY
No, you walk out.

ELAINE
Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.

JERRY
No, you wait for the movie!

ELAINE
(Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.

JERRY
You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.

KRAMER
(Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean
Martin show!

JERRY
So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?

ELAINE
That's a good idea.
(Kramer's cordless phone rings, startling him. He digs through his coat, and pulls it out of the pocket)

KRAMER
(Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.

JERRY
What strike?

KRAMER
Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked.

JERRY
You?

ELAINE
Worked?

JERRY
Bagels?

KRAMER
Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.

ELAINE
Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.

ELAINE
What were your.. demands?

KRAMER
Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.

ELAINE
I believe that's the new minimum wage.

KRAMER
Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)

NO, I"m sure they all got jobs.. like, ten years ago.

KRAMER
Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..

MANAGER
I could use someone for the holidays..

KRAMER
Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?

JERRY
Your hands were in the dough?

KRAMER
No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George

there had to be another way!

FRANK
Hello, woman. (leaves)

ELAINE
Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest?

KRAMER
No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.

MANAGER
Hey! I hired you to work during the holidays. This is the holidays.

KRAMER
But it's Festivus.

MANAGER
What?

KRAMER
You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..

MANAGER
That's not a right.

KRAMER
Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!

ELAINE
No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.

KRAMER
What? You're siding with management?!

ELAINE
No, I just..

KRAMER
(Interrupting) Scab! Scab! (pointing at Elaine) Scab!

[SETTING
Taxi Cab]
(Gwen joins Jerry in the cab. She's in her attractive state)

GWEN
Hey.

JERRY
Boy, am I glad to see you.

GWEN
You were expecting someone else?

JERRY
You never know.

GWEN
(To driver) You know, you might want to take the tunnel.

JERRY
So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?
(All the sudden, Gwen is extremely ugly)

GWEN
I can go either way.

JERRY
(Shocked) You're telling me.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
the Coffee Shop]

GEORGE
So, she was switching? Back and forth?

JERRY
Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.

GEORGE
So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.

JERRY
I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?

GEORGE
Lights out.

JERRY
Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.

GEORGE
(Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!

JERRY
That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.

GEORGE
I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.

JERRY
Oh, that's classy.
(Frank and Kramer enter. Frank is dragging an aluminum pole)

KRAMER
Well, Happy Festivus.

GEORGE
What is that? Is taht the pole?!

FRANK
George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you are.

GEORGE
(Sulking) That's why I hate it.

KRAMER
There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.

FRANK
George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, George as a child celebrating
Festivus is heard)

FRANK
Read that poem.

GEORGE
(Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!

FRANK
You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!

ESTELLE
Leave him alone!

FRANK
Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength.
(George has a break down)

GEORGE
No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus!

FRANK
We had some good times.
(Gwen walks in, and greets Jerry. She's in her unattractive state)

GWEN
Hey.

JERRY
I there. This is Kramer, and Frank.

GWEN
Hi.

KRAMER
(Shocked at her ugliness, he stammers) Hello.

GWEN
So, you ready to go?

JERRY
Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good
looking booth.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
H&H Bagel Shop]
(Kramer is picketing out side.)

KRAMER
Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, (Continues to chant)
(Cut to inside the store)

MANAGER
(To a waiting Elaine) Lady, if you want a sandwich, I'll make you a sandwich.

ELAINE
(Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.

KRAMER
(From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.

ELAINE
What did you do?

KRAMER
You've been warned.
(Elaine looks out the window, and sees Kramer at the pay phone)

ELAINE
Oh, hi! (Waves at him)
(Steam starts coming from a pipe on the machine. Elaine hangs up)

WORKER
Hey, the steam valve's broke.

MANAGER
Can we still make bagels?

WORKER
Sure. It's just a little steamy.
(Kramer knocks on the shop door)

KRAMER
Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!
(No one inside seems to care. Kramer waits by the door to see if anyone was affected)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Kruger Building]

KRUGER
George, I got something for you. (Pulls a check from his pocket) I'm suppose to find a charity and throw some of the company's money at it. They all
seem the same to me, so, what's the difference? (Hands the check to George)

GEORGE
20 thousand dollars?

KRUGER
Made out to the Human Fund. (Tries to enter his office, but it's locked) Oh, damn. I've locked myself out of my office again. Oh well. I'm going home.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Coffee Shop]

GWEN
Jerry, how many times do we have to come to this.. place?

JERRY
Why? It's our place.

GWEN
I just found a rubber band in my soup.

JERRY
Oh.. I know who's cooking today!
(Enter George)

GEORGE
Hey! Surprise, surprise!

JERRY
Hey, Georgie!

GWEN
I think I'm just gonna go.

JERRY
I'll be here.
(Gwen leaves)

GEORGE
(Sees Gwen's meal) Hey, soup.

JERRY
She didn't touch it.
(George spoons through his soup, and finds a rubber band)

GEORGE
Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)

JERRY
20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.

GEORGE
I don't know.

JERRY
Excuse me?

GEORGE
I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.

JERRY
You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.

GEORGE
I'm serious.

JERRY
You're going to start your own charity?

GEORGE
I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and
beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself).. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Outside H&H Bagels]
(Kramer is chanting 'no bagels, no bagels..' Elaine walks out, her make-up is distorted, and her face is pale because of the steam)

ELAINE
Kramer, the vest just called.

KRAMER
(Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night!

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.

KRAMER
And?

ELAINE
(Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.

KRAMER
Yeah.
(Gwen walks by, she's in her ugly state)

GWEN
Kramer, Hi!

KRAMER
Oh, hello.

GWEN
It's Gwen.. We met.. at the coffee shop.

KRAMER
Ah-huh.

GWEN
I'm dating your friend, Jerry..

KRAMER
Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.

GWEN
That's why we're always hiding in that coffee shop! He's afraid of getting caught.

KRAMER
Oh, he's a tomcat.
(Cut to Elaine)
(She meets up with Denim Vest on the street corner)

ELAINE
Steve.

DENIM VEST
Hmm?

ELAINE
It's Elaine.

DENIM VEST
From Tim Whatley's party?

ELAINE
Yeah.

DENIM VEST
You look.. different.

ELAINE
I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?

DENIM VEST
Well, I had it back at my place, but I can't go there now.. I'll give it to you later, or something.

ELAINE
No, no, no. You give me your number.

DENIM VEST
Okay. Sure. (Pulls out a pad, and starts writing a number down) Do you have the mumps?

ELAINE
No.

DENIM VEST
Typhoid?

ELAINE
No.

DENIM VEST
(Hands her the paper, and runs off) Yama - Hama!
(Elaine looks at the number, and sees it's the same as the number on a nearby truck)

ELAINE
A fake number! Blimey!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Kruger's office]

KRUGER
George, we have a problem. There's a memo, here, from accounting telling me there's no such thing as the Human Fund.

GEORGE
Well, there could be.

KRUGER
But there isn't.

GEORGE
Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out)

KRUGER
George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why you gave me a fake
Christmas gift.

GEORGE
Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.

KRUGER
Vemonous?

GEORGE
Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!

KRUGER
Are you making all this up, too?

GEORGE
Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.

KRUGER
Yeah, you probably should.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
The Costanza's house]

GEORGE
Happy Festivus!

FRANK
George? This is a surprise. (Looking at Kruger) Who's the suit?

GEORGE
Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.

FRANK
Have you seen the pole, Kruger?

GEORGE
Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.

FRANK
He's gonna see it.
(Enter Jerry and Elaine. Elaine is still ugly from the steam)

GEORGE
Happy Festivus! (Sees Elaine) Yama - Hama!

ELAINE
I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?

GEORGE
Embracing my roots.

JERRY
They nailed you on the 20 G's?

GEORGE
Busted cold.
(Cut to Kruger and Frank)
(They're looking at the Festivus pole)

FRANK
It's made from aluminum. Very high strength-to-weight ratio.

KRUGER
I find your belief system fascinating.
(Enter Kramer)
(Kramer's with the two bookies from Horse Track Betting)

KRAMER
Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee!

BOOKIE
Hello again, Miss Benes.

ELAINE
What are you doing here?

BOOKIE
Damnedest thing.. me and Charlie were calling to ask you out, and, uh, we got this bagel place..

KRAMER
(Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
(Estelle comes through the kitchen door, hitting Kramer as she opens it)

ESTELLE
Dinner's ready!

FRANK
Let's begin.

(EVERYONE SITS AROUND THE TABLE. KRUGER RECOGNIZED KRAMER FROM "THE MEAT SLICER" EPISODE..) KRUGER
Dr.. Van Nostrand?

KRAMER
Uh.. that's right.
(Cut to Frank)

FRANK
Welcome, new comers. The tradition of Festivus begins with the airing of grievances. I got a lot of problems with you people! And now you're gonna hear
about it! You, Kruger. My son tells me your company stinks!

GEORGE
Oh, God.

FRANK
(To George) Quiet, you'll get yours in a minute. Kruger, you couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.. I lost my train of thought.
(Frank sits down, Jerry gives a face that says "That's a shame". Gwen walks in)

GWEN
Jerry!

JERRY
Gwen! How'd you know I was here?

GWEN
Kramer told me.

KRAMER
Another Festivus miracle!
(Jerry gives Kramer a death stare. He shuts up. Gwen notices Elaine)

GWEN
I guess this is the ugly girl I've been hearing about.

ELAINE
Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.
(Gwen leaves, Jerry follows)

JERRY
Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch.

ELAINE
(To bookie) Hey, how'd my horse do?

BOOKIE
He had to be shot.

FRANK
And now as Festivus rolls on, we come to the feats of strength.

GEORGE
Not the feats of strength..

FRANK
This year, the honor goes to Mr. Kramer.

KRAMER
Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.

JERRY
I thought you were on strike?

KRAMER
Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.

GEORGE
Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?
(Exit Kramer)

KRUGER
(Sipping liquor from a flask) How about George?

FRANK
Good thinking, Kruger. Until you pin me, George, Festivus is not over!

GEORGE
Oh, please, somebody, stop this!

FRANK
(Taking off his sweater) Let's rumble!
(Cuts to an outside view of the Costanza's house)

ESTELLE
I think you can take him, Georgie!

GEORGE
Oh, come on! Be sensible.

FRANK
Stop crying, and fight your father!

GEORGE
Ow!.. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!

FRANK
This is the best Festivus ever!

[SETTING
H&H Bagel Shop]
(Kramer is shaping some dough and chewing gum - his gum falls into the dough. He starts looking for the gum, and starts extracting it from the dough. The manger is
watching)

MANAGER
Alright. That's enough. You're fired.

KRAMER
Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)
End.

[SETTING
A car dealership]
(Jerry and George are looking over some cars)

GEORGE
When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?

JERRY
Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..

GEORGE
Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.

JERRY
I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.

GEORGE
No. That's just electric.

JERRY
What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.

GEORGE
(Sarcastic) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?

JERRY
Well, what do you think the big holdup is?

GEORGE
The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.

JERRY
Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?

GEORGE
And the underwater bubble cities?

JERRY
It's like we're living in the '50s here.
(Kramer’s bouncing up and down on the rear bumper of one of the cars for sale)

KRAMER
It's good suspension!

JERRY
(To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)

GEORGE
What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.

JERRY
(Talking about the vein in George’s head) There's that vein again.

GEORGE
I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..

JERRY
(Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.

GEORGE
Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.

JERRY
I guess he graduated.

GEORGE
That's an easy move: go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.
(Kramer, in one of the cars, honks the horn)

JERRY
(To Kramer) Thank you.

GEORGE
Puddy’s just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptic) You’ll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Sudeenly, you’re
on your back like a turnip.

JERRY
Alright. Calm down.

GEORGE
My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, I’m gettin’ dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All
the kids are shoutin’ at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Let’s stuff Le George in Le Locker!"
(Kramer’s now on his back, under a car)

KRAMER
Jerry, I don’t think this thing is hooked up right.
(Jerry and George go to enter the office buildings)

JERRY
(To Kramer) Alright, we’re goin’ in.
(A salesman walks up to Kramer. He’s still under the car)

SALESMAN
You’ve got a good eye, there. I see you’ve noticed the uni-body construction. I’m Rick. Are you looking to buy or lease?
(Kramer emerges from under the car)

KRAMER
Uh, borrow. It’s for my friend. Yeah, he’ll be buying..

RICK
Maybe I should talk to him.

KRAMER
Oh, I don’t think so. No, he’s an entertainer. You know, all over the place. That’s where I come in.

RICK
I see. So, you’re his manag-
(Kramer hops into the car)

KRAMER
Yeah, neighbor. That’s right. Yeah, why don’t we take this boiler out for a shakedown?
(Scene cuts to the insides of the dealership building. Jerry and George are waiting for a salesman to assist them)

GEORGE
Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, "I’ll walk out of here right now!"
(A salesman approaches)

SALESMAN
Can I help you with something?

GEORGE
(Threatening) Hold it! One more step and we’re walkin’!

JERRY
(Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, we’re just waiting for David Puddy.

GEORGE
(Still with a tone) He is. You don’t know what I’m doin’ here.
(Elaine walks into the showroom with David Puddy)

ELAINE
Hey.

JERRY
Hey.

PUDDY
Sorry I’m late.

ELAINE
(Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.

JERRY
Ah. Where’d you go?

ELAINE
(Obviously embarrassed) Uh, to a restaurant.

PUDDY
Arby’s.

ELAINE
I had the roast beef..

JERRY
So, Puddy, I decided I’m gonna go with another 900 convertible.

PUDDY
Alright. Classic. (Holds his hand up) High-five.

ELAINE
(Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?

PUDDY
Oh, sure, babe. Salesman-only copy room (Points) right there.

ELAINE
Oh. (Leaves for the room)

PUDDY
(To Jerry and George) Hey, come on, guys. I’ll show you the 900.

GEORGE
(Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.
(Scene cuts to Kramer. He’s in the car with the salesman, Rick, and they’re driving an unknown street)

RICK
. And look at these features, Mr. Kramer: Anti-lock breaks, automatic climate control. Uh, (Points out the windshield) make a right at this corner, please.
(Goes back to the features) Adjustable steering wheel, and.. Oh, Mr. Kramer, you missed the turn..

KRAMER
No. No, I didn’t.

RICK
Well, that’s okay. (Pointing) We’ll make this next right, and swing around to get back to the dealership.

KRAMER
(Up to something) Well, it’s a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If I’m gonna recommend this car, I need to see that it’ll handle my daily
routine.

RICK
So where are we going?

KRAMER
Just a little place I like to call, "You’ll see".
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Puddy’s office]
(George and Jerry are in conference with Puddy)

GEORGE
I’m starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?

PUDDY
(Pointing out his office door) By the service department.

GEORGE
(Getting up, he addresses Jerry) Alright, remember: no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.

JERRY
(As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.

GEORGE
Don’t think it can’t happen! (Leaves)

JERRY
So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more "grease monkey".

PUDDY
I don’t care for that term.

JERRY
Oh. Sorry, I didn’t know..

PUDDY
No, I don’t know too many monkeys who could take apart a fuel injector.

JERRY
I saw one once that could do sign language.

PUDDY
Yeah, I saw that one. Uh.. Koko.

JERRY
Yeah, Koko.

PUDDY
Right, Koko. That chimp’s alright. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
(Returning, George sees Jerry reluctantly slap hands with Puddy)

GEORGE
Hey, hey, hey! What’s goin’ on here? (To Jerry) You didn’t agree to anything, did ya?

JERRY
No. We both just saw the same monkey.

GEORGE
(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left.

PUDDY
(Standing up) Well, there’s a vending machine. I could show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way)

GEORGE
(To Jerry) Hey, gimme a dollar.

JERRY
(Getting a dollar out) Where’s your money?

GEORGE
(Talking it) I’m here helpin’ you.
(Elaine enters)

ELAINE
Hey. Where’s Puddy? The copy machine is broken.

GEORGE
(On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. That’s what they want you to think.

JERRY
Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?

ELAINE
(Squints, imitating Puddy) The squinting?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
(Stares ahead, again, imitating Puddy) The staring?

JERRY
No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.

ELAINE
I thought all guys do that.

JERRY
Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - they’re using sign language now.

ELAINE
Is that bad?

JERRY
What do you think the Nazis were doin’? (Imitates the Nazi’s salute) That was the heil-five.

ELAINE
(Pointing out) Isn’t that from your act, like, ten years ago?

JERRY
(Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the ‘80’s, and it’s still relatable today.
(Puddy approaches them)

PUDDY
Good news. We got a 900 in black. That’s the hot color. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
(Elaine and Jerry exchange looks)

ELAINE
Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine?
(Elaine takes Puddy’s arm, leading him to the room)

PUDDY
(Pointing at Jerry) You owe me five.

Dealership back room]
(George is eyeing a Twix candy bar through the vending machine glass)

GEORGE
Twix.. (Makes various noises) B-5.
(George put in his dollar, but the machine rejects it. He tries to jam it in, same result. He tries one more time - unsuccessful)

GEORGE
Ah, come on!
(A heavy-set mechanic approaches and stands in line behind George to use the vending machine. George steps back to let him use it. The machine readily accepts
the mechanic’s dollar)

GEORGE
Ah, excuse me. Do you have change of a dollar?

MECHANIC
(While retrieving his candy) No.

GEORGE
Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?

MECHANIC
(While walking away) Don’t have one.

GEORGE
(Stopping him) Excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I glanced inside, and I couldn’t help but notice that you had several crisp dollar
bills.

MECHANIC
(Calm) You’re incorrect.

GEORGE
(Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? I’m very hungry.

MECHANIC
(While taking his exit) We had donuts earlier.

GEORGE
(Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! You’re all doin’ a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho,
ho. What I would do with you..

[SETTING
Dealership car]
(Rick and Kramer are still on the test-drive. The back seat is filled with various items - those including a giant, stuffed Tweety bird)

RICK
Mr. Kramer, we’re really not allowed to use the cars to run errands.

KRAMER
No, look, Rick. I’m very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh, Let’s see if
I can get a smile from these femininas.. (Yells out to them) Hey, Ladies! (Points to the car) It’s the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little
supplemental restraint?! (They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face) Geeze..
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Dealership back room]
(Jerry walks up to the vending machine. George is on his stomach, reaching under the vending machine for change)

JERRY
(Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.

GEORGE
People can drop change down here, Jerry. And they’re too lazy to pick it up.

JERRY
Either that, or they’ve got a little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why don’t you just go to the cashier?
(George gets up)

GEORGE
The cashier is at lunch - which is where I’d like to be.

JERRY
How much was under there?

GEORGE
(Looking at his finger) I think somethin’ bit me. I just need another nickel.

JERRY
(While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)

GEORGE
Ho, ho, ho! He’s got a live one. He’s just reeling his big fish in!

JERRY
Hey, can I have my dollar back?

GEORGE
(Stingy) It’s wrinkled. It’s worthless.
(Jerry gives George a look, then leaves. George hurriedly puts the money into the machine)

GEORGE
(As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on!
Jump!
(A man holding a donut walks past George)

MAN
They just put out some more donuts.

GEORGE
They did?

MAN
(Holding his up) Last one.

[SETTING
Dealership car]
(Kramer’s still on the road with Rick)

KRAMER
Well, just one more errand and we can head back.

RICK
Actually, it looks like we’re gonna need some gas.

KRAMER
Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?

RICK
(Looking) Well, it’s on "E".

KRAMER
You know, uh, oftentimes, Jerry - he lend me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I
don’t want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.

RICK
(Pointing out) So, you want to know how far you can drive your friend’s car for free.

KRAMER
(In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Dealership back room]
(George enters with a salesman, regarding the machine)

GEORGE
As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, it’s gone.
Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled "Employees Only". The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar)
What?! That guy’s eatin’ it!

SALESMAN
Well, how do you know that one’s yours?

GEORGE
Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He must’ve bought one, and gotten both.

SALESMAN
Sir, are you gonna buy a car?

GEORGE
No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the door’s window) Hey! Hey! I can see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats
the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!
(Scene cuts to Puddy in the copy room with Elaine. He’s trying to fix the Xerox machine)

PUDDY
Paper jam.. Got it! (Holds his hand up) High-five. (Elaine reluctantly slaps it. He turns around, and puts his hand out behind his back) On the flip side.

ELAINE
David, um, I..

PUDDY
(Still holding out his hand) Don’t leave me hangin’

ELAINE
You’re a salesman now - and the high-five is.. it’s very grease monkey.

PUDDY
What did I tell you about that?

ELAINE
I’m sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.

PUDDY
(Somewhat hurt) Oh yeah? I’ll tell you what’s stupid. You. Stupid.

ELAINE
Well, that is really mature.

PUDDY
Yeah? So are you.

ELAINE
Huh?

PUDDY
You’re the grease monkey.

ELAINE
(Confused at David’s attempts at a comeback) Uh.. that doesn’t make any sense. I am leaving.

PUDDY
Yeah, if you leave, we’re through.

ELAINE
Fine! We’re through!
PUDDY; Oh, so you’re leaving?

ELAINE
(While leaving) That’s right. (Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the
flip side! (As Elaine is leaving, she mutters to herself) Takin’ me to Arby’s..

JERRY
(Sees Elaine leaving) Hey! Wh-where are you..?
(She exits. Puddy sits down at his desk - disturbed)

PUDDY
Let’s finish this up.

JERRY
Did you two break up?

PUDDY
(While punching up numbers on a calculator) That chick’s whacked. We’re history. (Back to the transaction) I just left out a couple of things:
rust-proofing..

JERRY
"Rust-proofing"?

PUDDY
(Reading off what he’s adding up on the calculator) Transport charge, storage surcharge, additional overcharge, finder’s fee

JERRY
"Finder’s fee"? It was on the lot!

PUDDY
Yeah, that’s right. (Continues reading off) Floor mats, keys..

JERRY
‘Keys"?!

PUDDY
How ya gonna start it?
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Dealership’s shop]
(George catches up with the portly mechanic)

GEORGE
Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered
to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.

MECHANIC
First of all, it wasn’t a Twix. It was a 5th Avenue bar.

GEORGE
Huh. You must think I’m pretty stupid. That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a
cookie - and we all know Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.

MECHANIC
Yeah, it’s just a little nougat.

GEORGE
Nougat? Please. I think I’ve reached the point in my life where I can tell between nougat and cookie. So, let’s not just say things that are obvious
fabrications.

MECHANIC
(Pointing to George’s forehead) You know, you’re gettin’ a little vein there..

GEORGE
(Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I can’t believe this guy..
(Jerry rushes in with a box of candy)

JERRY
Hey, George!

GEORGE
Hey, starving! (Grabs the box from Jerry)

JERRY
No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, he’s treatin’ me just like a regular customer, now!

GEORGE
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn’t listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? There’s now laws in this place. Anything goes! It’s
Thunderdome!
(A saleswoman approaches them)

SALESWOMAN
Is someone helping you?
(Jerry and George quickly avoid her by leaving the room)

GEORGE
Stay back!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Dealership car]

RICK
(Trying to look at the gas gauge) Where is it now?

KRAMER
There’s still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the "E".

RICK
How long are you gonna go?

KRAMER
Oh, I’ve been in the slash many times. This is nothing. You’ll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) get it out of your mind.

RICK
Have you ever been completely below the slash?

KRAMER
Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I don’t know who did it, and I never got to
thank them..

RICK
(As the car slowly drifts off the road) Mr. Kramer, the road!
(Kramer swerves around, trying to get back in place)

KRAMER
Whoop! Whoop!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Puddy’s office]
(Jerry and George are in conference)

JERRY
(Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my
friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard.. ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George, vein it up.

GEORGE
Alright, Puddy, listen, and listen good: I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!

JERRY
George! Can we focus on the car, here?

GEORGE
I’m starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.

PUDDY
(Handing a sheet of paper to Jerry) Jerry, I just need your signature, here, and we’ll get you that yellow car ready to go.

JERRY
Yellow? I wanted black.

PUDDY
I can’t give you black at that price.

JERRY
(Pleading) George, could you help me, please?

GEORGE
(Standing up) Yes. This is wrong!

JERRY
Sing it, sister!

GEORGE
Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch..!

JERRY
(Exasperated) Uhhh..

GEORGE
(Losing it)..does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or… Lem is not gonna get away with this!
(Jerry follows George out the office)

JERRY
(To Puddy) I’ll be right back.

PUDDY
Okay.
(Jerry catches up with George)

JERRY
Hey, George!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Dealership car]
(The needle is now below "E". Rick is looking at it)

RICK
Is it just the angle I’m looking from?

KRAMER
No, Sir. We are down there.

RICK
Oh, this is amazing! Oh, I’ve never felt so alive!

KRAMER
Yeah, well, alright. I’m satisfied. We better get some gas.

RICK
What? Well, we can’t stop now.

KRAMER
What do you mean?

RICK
We have to keep going - all the way back to the dealership. That was the plan.

KRAMER
There was no plan.

RICK
Well, let’s make it the plan! Let’s just.. go for it! Like Thelma and Louise.

KRAMER
What, they drove to a dealership?

RICK
No, they drove off a cliff.
(Kramer eyes Rick, frightened)

KRAMER
You are one sick mama.. I like it.

RICK
Mr. Kramer, the road!
(Kramer swerves around again)

KRAMER
Yup! Yup!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Elaine’s apartment]
(Phone rings, she answers it)

ELAINE
Hello?

JERRY
(Over the phone) Elaine, you’ve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin’ me on this car, which is yellow now!

ELAINE
(Jokingly mimicking Jerry) Who is this?

JERRY
(Banging the phone against the booth) Elaine!
(Elaine flinches with every loud banging noise)

ELAINE
What?!

JERRY
You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.

ELAINE
(Sarcastic) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.

JERRY
You’re gonna get back together, anyway. It’s thousands of dollars!

ELAINE
Oh, I don’t know..

JERRY
Come on. Then you don’t have to see him again ‘til my 15,000-mile check.

ELAINE
Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?

JERRY
Fine.

ELAINE
And I didn’t like that roast beef, so how ‘bout some lunch?

JERRY
No. No lunch.

ELAINE
I’ll hang the phone up right now!

JERRY
Alright! Lunch!

ELAINE
I’ll see ya. (Hanging up the phone)

JERRY
Bye. (Hangs up)

JERRY
(Frustrated, he reacts) Everybody’s ripping me off!
(Scene cuts to George at the customer complaint window)

GEORGE
I’d like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.

WILLIE
When did you bring the car in?

GEORGE
(To the man behind him in line) Yeah right.. I’m gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why don’t I just flush my money down the toilet?

WILLIE
Sir, what, exactly, is the problem?

GEORGE
One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!

WILLIE
Are you saying he grabbed the candy bar away from you?

GEORGE
He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.

WILLIE
I thought you said it was a Twix.

GEORGE
Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.

WILLIE
Maybe it was.

GEORGE
Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.

WILLIE
What about the $100,000 bar?

GEORGE
No. Rice and caramel.

WILLIE
Nougat?

GEORGE
No.

WILLIE
Positive?

GEORGE
Please.
(A woman appears from behind the window)

WOMAN
You know they changed the name from $100,000 bar to 100 Grand?

GEORGE
All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!
(An old man sitting in a nearby chair speaks up. He’s Willie’s father)

WILLIE SR
I remember when you used to be able to get a Hershey for a nickel.
(The man behind George speaks up)

MAN
What’s the one with the swirling chocolate in the commercial?

GEORGE
They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!

WILLIE SR
Not Skittles.

WILLIE
Dad, I told you you could sit here only if you don’t talk.

WOMAN
(Sitting behind George) You make your father sit here all day?

WILLIE
He likes it!

GEORGE
Alright! Do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?

MAN
(In line behind George) Twix has too much coconut.

GEORGE
No! There’s no coconut!

WOMAN
(Behind service window) I’m allergic to coconut.

WILLIE
I’m not.

WILLIE SR
.A nickel!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Dealership office showroom]
(Elaine enters, and hands Jerry the receipt for her cab)

ELAINE
Cab receipt. Hey, Puddy.

PUDDY
I’m with a customer.
(Elaine throws up her hands, giving a face of dissatisfaction, and starts to walk away)

ELAINE
Uh..

JERRY
No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. What’s important is you two getting back together. Eh, then we’ll talk about the car.

PUDDY
(Like a kid) I don’t want to get back with her. She’s too bossy.

ELAINE
(Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David..

JERRY
Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why don’t we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. Now, look, you both find each
other attractive, right?

ELAINE AND PUDDY
Right.

JERRY
Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you..

ELAINE
I guess.

PUDDY
Good point.

JERRY
(Smiling, like a salesman) Alright. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today?
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Gas station]
(Kramer pulls the car into a gas station and gets out)

KRAMER
Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? I’ll get us a couple of Twix bars.

RICK
No, no coconut for me.

KRAMER
Alright, I’ll get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.
(Rick sits back in the car a second, then hurriedly jumps out and reaches for the gas pump. Kramer pops up from behind the pump and scares him)

RICK
Ahh!

KRAMER
No, man! Not the gas!

RICK
But it needs it, Kramer! It needs it bad!

KRAMER
Do you think that this’ll make you happy? ‘Cause it won’t!

RICK
(Walking away) Ah, you can just go on without me.
(Kramer grabs him by the collar)

KRAMER
Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, "Kramer and that
other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!"
(The car makes puttering noises)

RICK
Maybe we better get moving.

KRAMER
It’s good to have you back, Stan.
(Both hop into the car)

RICK
It’s Rick, by the way.

KRAMER
No time!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Dealership’s customer service room]

WILLIE
Mr. Costanza, I really don’t have time for this.

GEORGE
Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claimed, wouldn’t you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a
candy line-up?

WILLIE
"Candy line-up"?

GEORGE
I’ve spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers of identification of any kind for him to select from.

WILLIE
It took you an hour?

GEORGE
Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you.. the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room.
Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars)

SALESWOMAN
Hey, Willie, check it out! Free candy!

GEORGE
That’s my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! They’re - they’re all on the floor!
(George starts picking up the numbered cards from off the floor. He sees the mechanic eating one of the candy bars)

GEORGE
And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!

MECHANIC
No.

MAN
Hey, this Clark bar is good.

GEORGE
It’s a Twix! They’re all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And you’ve robbed it! You’ve all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!

MECHANIC
They’re all gone.

GEORGE
(Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Ttttttwwwwiiiiiixxxxx!
(Scene cuts to Elaine, Puddy and Jerry, all in conference)

ELAINE
What was that?

PUDDY
There’s a mental hospital right near here.

JERRY
Alright. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle: Arby’s - no more than once a month. In exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and
doesn’t read a book.

ELAINE
(While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah, well, that’s not bad.

PUDDY
I can live with that.

JERRY
So, you’re back together?

PUDDY
Yeah.
(Jerry sees them stare at each other, smiling)

JERRY
Alright, alright. Alright, that’s enough! Let’s get back to my deal. That undercoating, that’s just a rip-off, isn’t it, David?

PUDDY
Oh, we don’t even know what it is.

JERRY
So, I’m gettin’ the insider’s deal?

PUDDY
Insider’s deal. (Holds up his hand) High-five.
(Jerry gives a face of resentment)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Dealership car]
(Rick and Kramer are driving back to the dealership)

RICK
(Seeing the turn-off up ahead) There’s the dealer!

KRAMER
Hey!

RICK
We did! We pulled it off! I can’t believe it! Where’s the needle?

KRAMER
Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!

RICK
Oh, Mr. Kramer, I gotta thank you. I - I learned a lot. Things are gonna be different for me now.

KRAMER
Well, that’s a weird thing to say..

RICK
I wonder how much longer we could have lasted.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah. I wonder.. hmm.
(They both eye each other, then Kramer slams on the gas, attempting to go even longer. They both cheer and scream out)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
NYC Cab]
(Elaine, George, and Jerry are riding home in a cab)

ELAINE
This is nice. What kind of car is this?

CABBIE
Caprice Classic.

ELAINE
(To Jerry) You couldn’t just give him one high-five?

JERRY
And where does it end? Then, everyone’s doin’ it. It’s like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, "Don’t go there." - Someone’s gotta take a
stand!

GEORGE
(Munching on a hamburger) This Arby’s is good.

ELAINE
So, George, I still don’t understand - how was that a setup?

JERRY
And who were you tryin’ to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?

GEORGE
(In the spotlight) I don’t know. All of ‘em. They’re all crooks! Besides, I couldn’t get all different candy bars, anyway.
(Kramer and Rick speed by the cab in the Saab - both screaming and yelling)

GEORGE
What was that?

JERRY
I think there’s a mental hospital near here.

ELAINE
Very near.
(Scene cuts to Kramer and Rick. Still yelling, they slowly come to a stop)

KRAMER
Whew! Well, I think we stopped.

RICK
You - you can probably let go of my hand now.

KRAMER
Oh, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, I’ll think about it..

RICK
Do you have my card?
End.
Waitress giving Elaine her meal at Monk's.

WAITRESS
Careful, this plate is extremely hot.
Elaine touching the plate.

ELAINE
Thank you. Ow!

WAITRESS
I just told you it was hot. Why'd you touch it?

ELAINE
I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
Puddy entering Monk's in a fur coat

PUDDY
Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?
Elaine cracking up when she sees Puddy's coat.

ELAINE
I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?

PUDDY
It's my winter coat.

ELAINE
A fur?
Puddy sits down in the booth.

PUDDY
Is there a problem?

ELAINE
A seemingly infinite supply.
Elaine touching the plate again.

ELAINE
Ow! Careful, it's hot.
Puddy touching the plate.

PUDDY
Ow!
Jerry, in his apartment with Elaine and George.

JERRY
So, Puddy wear's a man fur?

ELAINE
He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.

JERRY
And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.

ELAINE
Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.

GEORGE
And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?

ELAINE
We never dated in winter.

JERRY
You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.

ELAINE
Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.

GEORGE
An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.

JERRY
Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.

GEORGE
All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.

JERRY
Cheapness is not a sense.

ELAINE
I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the
ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...

JERRY
I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
Kramer enters Jerry's apartment with Newman.

KRAMER
Hey.

JERRY
Hey.

KRAMER
You got any pliers?

JERRY
What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?

NEWMAN
Hilarious.

KRAMER
Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.

ELAINE
Why?

NEWMAN
To prevent an ambush.

KRAMER
Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.

JERRY
But then anyone can just look in and see you.

KRAMER
Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'

ELAINE
I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
Jerry pulls a stub of paper out of his wallet.

JERRY
Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.

KRAMERT
Mmm... Nice wallet.

NEWMAN
Wallet.

JERRY
What?
Kramer showing Jerry the contents of his pocket

KRAMER
Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll.
See, keep the big bills on the outside.

JERRY
That's a five.

KRAMER SINGING AS HE SWITCHES HIS PEEPHOLE AROUND

Silvio coming up behind Kramer

SILVIO
Eh, what are you doing?

KRAMER
Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.

SILVIO
Hey, you know you gotta get permission from me. I'm the super. Who said you could do that?

KRAMER
Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?

SILVIO
Like what?

KRAMER
Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.

SILVIO
No, no, no, no. No, that's all right.

KRAMER
Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--

SILVIO
Newman? He did this, too?

KRAMER
Well, yeah.

SILVIO
I deal with him.
George showing Jerry a newspaper ad.

GEORGE
Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.

JERRY
Except the store's in Delaware.

GEORGE
I'll have 'em overnight it.

JERRY
Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.

GEORGE
It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.

JERRY
Why?
George pulling out his wallet.

GEORGE
Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.
Jerry holding up a hamburger while holding George's wallet.

JERRY
But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.

GEORGE
I need everything in there.
Jerry looking through George's wallet

JERRY
Irish money?

GEORGE
I might go there.

JERRY

George grabbing back his wallet.

GEORGE
All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.
(Newman walks up to Kramer's door, looks into his reverse peephole, and sees Kramer, wearing an open shirt, scratching his stomach with a backscratcher, with
opera music playing in the background. Newman knocks on the door, and Kramer startingly peers into his reverse peephole)

KRAMER
Who is it?

NEWMAN
It's Newman.

KRAMER
What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.

NEWMAN
I can't believe I'm being evicted.

KRAMER
What? What are you talking about?

NEWMAN
The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and I'm out of the building.

KRAMER
No. No, he can't do that.

NEWMAN
I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out of a bucket.

KRAMER
Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.
(Kramer closes his door behind him to go with Newman, when Newman sees that he's still wearing his open shirt)

NEWMAN
Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.
Jerry, at Joe Mayo's party with George.

JERRY
George, I am loving this no wallet thing.

GEORGE
A man carries a wallet.

JERRY
You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
Joe Mayo, coming up to George and Jerry.

JOE MAYO
Hey, Jerry.

JERRY
Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place.

JOE MAYO
Thanks. George, can you do me a favor and stay by the phone in case anybody calls and needs directions?
George tossing his coat on a chair.

GEORGE
Love to.

JOE MAYO
Thanks. Jerry...

JERRY
Music?

JOE MAYO
Actually, can you keep an eye on the aquarium and make sure nobody taps on the glass?

JERRY
But I could do that and the music.

JOE MAYO
Oh, no, don't worry about the music. Just... have fun!

JERRY
I was ready to get jiggy with it.
Elaine entering the party with Puddy who's wearing his fur coat.

PUDDY
Hey.

JERRY
Hey, Elaine.

ELAINE
Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.
Jerry showcasing his no-wallet look.

JERRY
So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?
Elaine eyeing Jerry patheticall, then turning to George.

ELAINE
So, George... did you get the chair?

GEORGE
No, I don't have it yet.

JERRY
So, we're givin' him nothing?
George pulling out a picture of the chair.

GEORGE
No, I brought a picture of the chair.

JERRY
Did you at least get him a card?

GEORGE
I thought we'd all sign the picture.
Joe Mayo walking up to the gang with an armload of guests' coats.

JOE MAYO
Elaine...

ELAINE
Hey, Joe Mayo.

JOE MAYO
I need you to be in charge of coats.
Elaine being given all the coats and Puddy's fur coat thrown on top.

ELAINE
Oh, fantastic.

JOE MAYO
And Puddy, can you make sure no one puts a drink on my...sound system?

PUDDY
Sure thing, Joe Mayo.
Jerry over by the aquarium talking to a girl.

JERRY
Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?

KERI
Nice.

JERRY
(talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.

GEORGE
(answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?

PUDDY
(standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! Cocktail off the speaker.
(Putting the coats on a bed, Elaine sees the window, opens it, and throws Puddy's coat out)

ELAINE
Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.
Silvio with his wife, Kramer, and Newman in Jerry's apartment.

SILVIO
Why are we in Jerry's apartment?

KRAMER
Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.

SILVIO
Make it quick Kramer, my wife and I are about to go bowling.

KRAMER
Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?

SILVIO
I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator.

KRAMER
Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.

SILVIO
OK, on your word he can stay.

KRAMER
All right.

SILVIO
But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him.

KRAMER
Well, you won't regret it.
(Kramer looks up at Newman and he sees him close to kissing Silvio's wife. Silvio, sees the cigar fall right out of Kramer's mouth.

SILVIO
What's wrong?
(Kramer hurriedly picks the cigar up, but puts the wrong end in his mouth, burning his tongue, and quickly replacing it the right way in his mouth)

JOE MAYO
Elaine, thanks for coming.

ELAINE
Good working with you.
Puddy coming up to them in his fur coat ready to go.

PUDDY
All right, let's hit the bricks.
Elaine sees Puddy still having a coat.

ELAINE
What?

JOE MAYO
Hey, I got a coat just like this!

ELAINE
Oh. Uhhh...
Elaine at Monk's with George and Jerry.

ELAINE
So Joe Mayo had the same coat.

GEORGE
And you threw it out the window?

ELAINE
Mm-hmm.

GEORGE
God, you're like a rock star.

ELAINE
So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.

JERRY
Because you threw it out.

ELAINE
No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.

JERRY
But you did actually throw his coat out the window.

ELAINE
But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.

JERRY
But that's you.

ELAINE
So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.
George, taking out his wallet to pay the check.

GEORGE
Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.

JERRY
Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
George replacing his wallet in his pocket.

GEORGE
This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.

ELAINE
Look at you. You're on a slant.

GEORGE
Here, just give me a couple of napkins.
(He pulls some napkins out of the dispenser, puts them in his other back pocket, and becomes un-slanted)

GEORGE
There, there I'm fine.
(Suddenly, half of George's body falls with a crunch sound, as he becomes slanty the other way now)

JERRY
What was that?

GEORGE
I think I had some hard candy in there.
George sees the delivery man bringing the massage chair into his apartment.

GEORGE
No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.
George sits down in the chair.

GEORGE
Ahhh. How does this thing work?
George turns the chair on.

GEORGE
hhhhh...

DELIVERY MAN
Sir, do you want me to deliver this to your friend's place or not?

GEORGE
Ahhhhh...
Keri meeting Jerry on the street.

KERI
Ready to go?

JERRY
All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.

KERI
You don't go that often?

JERRY
No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?
Keri handing him a bunch of miscellaneous items that would seem to normally go in her purse.

KERI
Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me?

JERRY
Compact, lipstick, all this?
Keri, handing him a gigantic ring of keys.

KERI
And can you help to carry my keys?
Jerry looks at the keys.

JERRY
What are you, a medieval dungeon master?
Keri, handing him another item as she starts to walk down the street.

KERI
And a tin of altoids.
Jerry puts it all in his pocket and then trying to catch up to her

JERRY
Ow! Sharp key.
Kramer walks on the street with Newman

KRAMER
So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?

NEWMAN
Well, there's very little sleeping going on.

KRAMER
Well, why didn't you tell me about this?

NEWMAN
Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.

KRAMER
Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.
Newman stops under a tree on the street and looking up into it.

NEWMAN
Hey, what is that up that tree?

KRAMER
Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.

NEWMAN
No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.
Kramer boosting Newman into the tree.

KRAMER
Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?

NEWMAN
The Pacific Northwest.
Elaine with Jerry at his apartment.

ELAINE
So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.

JERRY
You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.
Elaine making a bowl of cereal.

ELAINE
You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.

JERRY
Not more of that crap from the Titanic?

ELAINE
No. No. It's a small men's carryall.

JERRY
I'm not carrying a purse.
Elaine sits down at the table to eat her cereal.

ELAINE
It's not a purse. It's European.
Jerry sits down with Elaine.

JERRY
Oh.

ELAINE
Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?
Jerry dialing his phone.

JERRY
I don't know.

ELAINE
If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
George answering his phone, while still using the massage chair.

GEORGE
Yeah?

JERRY
Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?

GEORGE
Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
It's in... transit.

ELAINE
Did he get it?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.
George (hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out?

JERRY
Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.

GEORGE
Allllll right!

JERRY
What is that noise?

GEORGE HANGS UP THE PHONE
That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!

JERRY
You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
Kramer enters Jerry's apartment and handing Jerry back his pliers.

KRAMER
Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.

ELAINE
Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.

KRAMER
Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.

ELAINE
What are you talking about?

KRAMER
Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!
Elaine pushing Kramer in her 'get-out!' style.

ELAINE
88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!

JERRY
What was that pop sound?

KRAMER
Well, I had some hard candy in there.
Newman enters Elaine's apartment.

NEWMAN
So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?
Elaine taking his coat and then throwing it on the floor.

ELAINE
Come in, come in.

NEWMAN
Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.

ELAINE
Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.

NEWMAN
This isn't about my opening your mail?

ELAINE
What?

NEWMAN
Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already open.

ELAINE
Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.

NEWMAN
Sorry. Climbers, keepers.

ELAINE
You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.

NEWMAN
You are?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.

NEWMAN
Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.

ELAINE
Ha ha ha ha.

NEWMAN
Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?

ELAINE
Uh, don't worry, he's cool.

NEWMAN
Cool?

ELAINE
Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?

NEWMAN
Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.

ELAINE
All right, we're done here.

NEWMAN
For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of the apartment, where I would be
dancing on the sidewalk--

ELAINE
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
Keri putting her things into Jerry's carryal.

KERIL
Nice carryall.

JERRY
It's European.

KERI
Do you still have my lipstick?

JERRY
Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?

KERI
My job was to keep you away from the music.

JERRY
What, he doesn't like my taste in music?

KERI
Guess not.

JERRY
You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
Silvio, running up and knocking on Kramer's door.

SILVIO
Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I can see you through the reverse peephole.

KRAMER
Hey, Silvio!
Silvio holding up a fur coat.

SILVIO
Look at this.

KRAMER
Huh?

SILVIO
Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?

KRAMER
Relax, Silvio.

SILVIO
No, that's it. You're both out of the building!

KRAMER
Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!

SILVIO
A man's?

KRAMER
Yeah.

SILVIO
What kind of a man would wear fur?

KRAMER
Oh, lots of 'em.

SILVIO
Would you?

KRAMER
No.

SILVIO
Then who?

KRAMER
What about Jerry?

SILVIO
Jerry?

KRAMER
Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.

SILVIO
Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please, look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!

KRAMER
Yeah, something like that.
Jerry in his apartment with Kramer.

JERRY
I have to do what?

KRAMER
All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.

JERRY
I'm not wearing the fur.

KRAMER
Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.

JERRY
Is that right?

KRAMER
All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?

JERRY
Newman, too?

KRAMER
Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.

JERRY
That's my walkman!

KRAMER
And you'll get it back.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.

GEORGE
Hey.

KRAMER
Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.

JERRY
George, did you get that chair yet?

GEORGE
It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?

JERRY
You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.

GEORGE
Excuse me?

JERRY
Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.

GEORGE
Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?

KRAMER
Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?

GEORGE
He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.

KRAMER
I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.

GEORGE
Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?

JERRY
No, you don't have to buy anything.

GEORGE
I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!

JERRY
I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?

GEORGE
I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.

JERRY
Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!

GEORGE
Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.

JERRY
Your good friend is morbidly obese.

GEORGE
Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.

JERRY
It's not a purse. It's European!

KRAMER
All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come
right back.

JERRY
All right.
Kramer puts the coat on Jerry.

KRAMER
There you go.

JERRY
How do I look?

KRAMER
Ahh....
George pulls down a tab from an ad he sees on the street.

GEORGE
Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.
(George puts the stub of paper in his wallet, and tries to close it, everything inside it flies out as the whole wallet explodes)

GEORGE
My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!

JERRY
Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.

SILVIO
That is your coat?

JERRY
It sure is.

SILVIO
Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and you're desperate for attention.

JERRY
That's true.
Kramer giving Jerry his carryal.

KRAMER
Jerry, you forgot your purse.

JERRY
Oh, thanks.

KRAMER
Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.

JERRY
Maybe this isn't my coat.

KRAMER
All right, you're not fancy!

SILVIO
No, he's very fancy! Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses!
Elaine, coming up to them on the street.

ELAINE
Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.

JERRY
No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.

ELAINE
No, that's not your coat.

SILVIO
If that is not his coat, whose coat is it?

ELAINE
It's Joe Mayo's coat.

SILVIO
Who's Joe Mayo?

KRAMER
That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
(A pickpocket runs by, taking Jerry's carryall, while everyone yells in surprise)

JERRY
Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!

COP
Your what?

JERRY
The...black, leather...thing with a strap.

COP
You mean a purse?

JERRY
Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!
Jerry, on the phone with Elaine putting his things back into his wallet

JERRY
So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?

ELAINE
Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.

JERRY
He should have had a reverse peephole.
Puddy entering Elaine's apartment in a new bright, multi-colored leather coat.

PUDDY
Hey, Babe.
Elaine hangs up the phone to talk to Puddy.

JERRY
Hello? Hello?

ELAINE
What is that?

PUDDY
It's my new coat.

ELAINE
You ditched the fur?

PUDDY
Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball.

ELAINE
You're gonna wear this all the time?

PUDDY
All signs point to 'Yes!'
End.
Some street , Jerry and Kramer walking

JERRY
So your saying UNICEF is a scam?

KRAMER
It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation. No one can keep track of all those kids
with the little orange boxes of change.

JERRY
Oh! No it's Sally Weaver.
We see Sally from a distance.

KRAMER
Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh?

JERRY
No , It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago. she's trying
to become an actress.

KRAMER
Hmmm,, Dramatica comedia heh!

JERRY
Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation.
It's really depressing.

KRAMER
Euh.. We don't go to enough theater.

JERRY
She should just give up.
She recognizes them.

JERRY
Heeyyy!...

SALLY
Hey there Mr. Too big to come to my shows. I just came back from (?) Whoooooooo.....I'm on my
way to an audition
still waiting for that big break.

KRAMER
Why don't you just give up?

JERRY
Kramer!!!

KRAMER
At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen.
All right , we go grab some bouffe. Join us?
Kramer leaves both Sally and Jerry speechless

JERRY
So......Susan's dead.....
At Monks

KRAMER
I think she was happy someone finally said it.

JERRY
Why'd you have to say anything to her?

KRAMER
'felt that the conversation was lagging.

JERRY
Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?

KRAMER
I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your
place.
Pushes Jerry out of the booth and leaves.

ELAINE
You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up. I have.

JERRY
What did you wanna be?

ELAINE
I don't remember , but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get
this.

JERRY
I don't either.

ELAINE
And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
George comes in

GEORGE
Hey!

ELAINE
Hey! George look at this.

GEORGE
That's cute.

ELAINE
You got it?

GEORGE
No , never mind.

ELAINE
Come on , We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in
an office.

JERRY
It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.

ELAINE
The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".

GEORGE
Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner.

ELAINE
It's a page number.

GEORGE
Well , I can't crack this one.

ELAINE
Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.

GEORGE
try shaking it...(long pause) Well ,Janet should be here any minute.

JERRY
You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?

GEORGE
Aah! the minute I saw this girl , we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her
mouth, nose

ELAINE
We know what a face consists of.
Janet arrives
Janet; I'm sorry I'm late.
George; Jerry , Elaine, I give you.. Janet.

JANET
Nice to meet you.

ELAINE
Hi!
Janet; Do we still have time to make the movie?
George; Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
George goes to the cashier and empties out the candy bowl ,they leave.

ELAINE
Jerry , She looks exactly like you.

JERRY
She does not.

ELAINE
Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.
To Jerry's place , Kramer is already there making himself a lunch.

JERRY
Hey! Kramer.

KRAMER
hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm...George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call.
and some Sally woman called said "Thanks a lot , she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.

JERRY
What! You're the one who ruined her life.

KRAMER
Well that's not how she remembers it.

JERRY
Well , I got to talk her out of this.
Kramer; I thought you said she stinks

JERRY
She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the
traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
Door buzzer rings

JERRY
Yeah...

GEORGE
Hey! George and Janet.

KRAMER
Aahh...Who's Janet?

JERRY
George's girlfriend , Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say ,kookie talk.
Kramer; You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.

ALL
Hey, Hey!

KRAMER
And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins.. WOoooohhhhh!!!
this is eerie.

GEORGE
Kramer , what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry

JANET
well maybe we do look a little like each other.

GEORGE
No..hummm , What do you know about what you look like.

KRAMER
C'mon George relax. Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.
George; (nervous) All right now we're going bye bye.

JANET
We just got here George

GEORGE
Well,,, it's getting dark.
They leave.

KRAMER
yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.
Jerry slaps him in the back.

JERRY
What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his
girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I

KRAMER
Well how should I have "broached the subject"

JERRY
You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.

KRAMER
Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.

JERRY
Yeah! Because of you.

KRAMER
Well, I think one of us should leave.
They stare at each other for a while, then the scene cuts to Monks.

JERRY
Sally ,you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.

SALLY
(nods) Hehumm!!

JERRY
You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink?
When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink , You suck. We like magic.

SALLY
Really?

JERRY
Of course , I stink , you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..

SALLY
Yeah! You've been stinking since the Eighties.

JERRY
All right , I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with
everybody else.

SALLY
Right! , Yesss!! Thank you I'm gonna do it. (starts to eat her food)

JERRY
NOW!!!!.... ( she leaves in a hurry)
Back to Jerry's place , evening.

ELAINE
Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why
no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

JERRY
Oh! I think we're at the bottom.

ELAINE
(to George who just came in) Hey! George , Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome
woman.

GEORGE
What does that mean?

JERRY
Yeah. What does that mean?

GEORGE
(to Jerry) What do you mean by that?

ELAINE
Enjoy. ( she leaves)
Jerry; Elaine huh?.. She's completely..

GEORGE
Oh! I know....'Cos you don't think Janet?..

JERRY
No....

GEORGE
Why would I...
Jerry; It's ludicrous..

GEORGE
Yes.

JERRY
For either one of us..

GEORGE
No...
Jerry; So...

GEORGE
Exactly.

JERRY
I'm not gay.

GEORGE
..neither am I.

BOTH
Kramer, Kramer , get in here.

GEORGE
Where's the crazy man , Come on up.

JERRY
Come on in here.
AS Kramer steps out and comes in

GEORGE
Haaaaaa!!!

JERRY
What's happening? What, you doing , come and talk to us.

KRAMER
I've made an important life decision.

JERRY
Lets talk about that.

GEORGE
Don't leave (George slams the door)

KRAMER
Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life
you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry

GEORGE
What's the decision?

KRAMER
I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do.
I'm never gonna talk again.

JERRY
Yeah right.

KRAMER
What do I need to talk for.. ha! , For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry
friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of
some girl and his best friend.
See now , I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.

GEORGE
Silence YES!!
Jerry; Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.

KRAMER
Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.
Kramer does mimics but you can make out somebody angry saying "What are you talking about, twice and then some crying)

JERRY
Well what does this mean?

KRAMER
Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.

GEORGE
(frantic by now) SHUT UP ,SHUT UP , SHUT UP,...(then leaves)

KRAMER
That's the idea.

JERRY
Kramer there's no way you stick to this.

KRAMER
(makes a zipper gesture to his mouth)..Weeeeeepp!!

JERRY
Oh! you just startin' now?
Kramer; that's right......Aye oooh!!...Right now.
Kramer turns abruptly and hit his knees on the coffee table
Kramer Ouch!!..........Now!!
Next day at the New Yorker

MR. ELINOFF
So, J. Peterman wants to hire some of our cartoonists to illustrate your catalog?

ELAINE
Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier ,people
won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
Elaine shows him the cartoon

MR. ELINOFF
Oh! yeah... That's a rather clever jab at inter office politics don't you think.

ELAINE
Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?

MR. ELINOFF
Well Miss Benes. Cartoons are like gossamer and one doesn't dissect gossamer. heh..hemm..
Elaine; Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?

MR. ELINOFF
Ha! It's merely a commentary on contemporary mores. (slides the magazine to her)

ELAINE
But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him)

MR. ELINOFF
It's a slice of life.

ELAINE
No it isn't.

MR. ELINOFF
Pun?

ELAINE
I don,t think so.

MR ELINOFF
Vorshtein?

ELAINE
That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?

MR ELINOFF
No.

ELAINE
Then why did you print it.

MR. ELINOFF
I liked the kitty.

ELAINE
(gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears
at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.

MR. ELINOFF
Actually that's not bad..

ELAINE
Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others
Cuts to the Samuel Beckett Theatre
Jerry; Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?

SALLY
No, no.. It's just a little performance piece I wrote... You know what? You really inspired me ,oKay , a tear.
Kramer joins Jerry just as the show starts

JERRY
Ah! There you are.( Kramer motions silence)
Jerry; Aw.. right , code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!...
Applause, Sally starts her show

SALLY
Hi everybody think you're really going to like this 'cos it' about me...All right it's not just about me

Jerry on the street and he says to me " Sally , You stink , You should give up acting." Oh! I'm doing
Jerry Now so you've got imagine I have ; horns , a tail and hooks instead of feet. ( big laughs from the
audience and Kramer is cracking up)

JERRY
( to Kramer) Oh! Shut up!!!
Next day at Jerry's

ELAINE
She does a full hour about how you're the devil.I got to go see this thing.

JERRY
Good luck , It's sold out for the next three weeks.

ELAINE
Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from...The New Yorker.

JERRY
The New Yorker?

ELAINE
Yes , The New Yorker , I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon
...MADE NO SENSE....

JERRY
Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew

ELAINE
Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.

JERRY
Nodding off...

ELAINE
...And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.

JERRY
Wow! that's incredible......But you don't draw.

ELAINE
I do to.

JERRY
What , your sad little horsies , the house with the little curl of smoke , the sunflower with the smiley
face. the transparent cube... ( as she leaves)

ELAINE
It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.

JERRY
Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
Back to Monks, same day

SALLY
Jerry , sorry I'm late. Channel Nine is doing a piece on my show. Isn't that great? Do you hate me?

JERRY
No ,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld
is the devil.

SALLY
Well...That is the title.

JERRY
I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.

SALLY
You know I workshopped that and.. SNOOZERS!!! he he he....but I'll tell you what I'll think...
It's all a journey.

JERRY
You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater)
Newman shyly approaches the table

NEWMAN
Excuse me Miss Weaver , OH! My god it is you! I.. I've seen your show six times..

JERRY
What a surprise.

NEWMAN
Aahh! You're great ,It's great , It's so great to see a show that's (looks at Jerry) about something.
Kramer climbs into a cab

DRIVER
Where to?
Kramer realizes that he can't talk so quickly gets out of the cab.
Evening at Janet's apt.

GEORGE
(we hear him think) My friends are idiots , she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody.
And so what if does look like Jerry ,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry
but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly
what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry..

SALLY
You know I really do look like your friend Jerry.

GEORGE
I know....
Back to Jerry's

TV ANNOUNCER
Thanks for watching Nine News. We leave you tonight with a scene from Sally Weavers One woman show.

SALLY
Ok so I go to meet Jerry Seinfeld at this horrible coffee shop right? And he's like "Hey stop doing
your show." and I'm like, Hello! It's a free country. So then he goes." Okay Shmootsie" and
he starts pulling at my sweater right?. He's getting , you know, Hands Across America.

JERRY
There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her

SALLY
..And this is what he looks like when he's eating...

JERRY
Get Out of my House!!.
Elaine walks in the door looking terrible

ELAINE
Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.

JERRY
I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.

ELAINE
That is not the point.

JERRY
some mouthwash , a hat , something.

ELAINE
Just read it!

JERRY
(glances at it) Pretty good.

ELAINE
Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem. Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What?
It's funny.

JERRY
It's a pig at a complain department.

ELAINE
And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.

JERRY
I get it.

ELAINE
Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.

JERRY
How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.

ELAINE
Everything with you has to be so.. jokey.

JERRY
I'm a comedian.

ELAINE
I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.

JERRY
Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.

ELAINE
I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks , The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their
next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally
Weaver.

JERRY
oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.
Picks up a phone and dials Sally's number. Kramer taps on a sheet of paper that he gives to Elaine to read.

ELAINE
The pig says "my wife is a slut."

JERRY
Now that's a complaint....Hello Sally , yeah this is Jerry ,I just wanted to leave you a message that I
caught your little piece on TV and..
Instant switch to the club where Sally is playing the message that Jerry left on her message.

JERRY
...I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave
me out of your act all together.

JERRY
(from the back of the club , leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
Still Sally's act but seen on his TV back in his apartment.

SALLY
To cease and desist on behalf of my client, Jerry Seinfeld. Signed ; Crybaby Jerry Seinfeld's Lawyer.
Ok but I got two words for you Jerry Seinfeld...( censored beep)...You

JERRY
How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special. I 've never gotten a
cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado.
( to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him)...Exactly.
At Peterman's office, next day. Elaine posted her cartoon on her door.

ELAINE
Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it? ( Dugan shrugs)
Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he.

PETERMAN
Elaine, I'm afraid I have incurred yet another flat tire.

ELAINE
Can I fix that after lunch sir?

PETERMAN
Oh! no right away , chop, chop........Oh! a new cartoon....."I wish I was taller (hearty laugh)
I'd like to see that complaint get rectified. (more laughs and he leaves)

ELAINE
(to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why?
'Cause I wrote it.

DUGAN
You shouldn't make fun of pigs. ( he leaves)
Peterman (returns) Flash of lightning Elaine I just realized why I like this cartoon so much.

ELAINE
Oh! Do tell sir?
Peterman It's a Ziggy!

ELAINE
A Ziggy?

PETERMAN
That irreverence , that wit I'd recognize it anywhere. Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and
passed it off as his own. I can prove it. Quick Elaine , to my archives.
In a restaurant later that evening.

GEORGE
You know , you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.

JANET
It's not?
George; No , Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met , we had a great conversation.

JANET
I remember you said I was the prettiest girl at the party.

GEORGE
...But after that we really talked didn't we?

JANET
Well ,you told me how familiar I looked and that you must have seen me somewhere before.

GEORGE
Na....no... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very
serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened?

JANET
You asked for a piece of gum because you thought your breath smelled like hummus.

GEORGE
Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.

JANET
I like gum.

GEORGE
I do too. you see that's what we're about. You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.

JANET
I have gum in my hair.

GEORGE
I'm losin' it
Back to Monks
Sally (joining Kramer)Hey! Your Jerry's friend. You're Goofy , mind if I sit. My show is going really well.
Have you seen it yet? you should. Everybody else have and you know what? I got recognized the other day,
How weird is that. I know. At first I liked the attention but it's like Whoa!! take three steps back ,
Get a life, okay. but then there wouldn't be a Sally Weaver without the fans, know what I mean.
But who am I? anyway. I mean there's Sally weaver the woman , Sally Weaver the artist , Sally Weaver the person...

KRAMER
(loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.

SALLY
Well , lay it on me string bean.
Janet's apt. She is in the bedroom.

JANET
Let me get this gum out of my hair and then I'll be ready for bed.

GEORGE
OK Look , the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.

JANET
George.
George turns around to see Janet with short Jerry like hair and a jerry like blue shirt.

GEORGE
Your hair?

JANET
Well I had to cut the gum out and I had a little trouble getting it even. So why don't you get undressed
George. ( George speeds out the door)

GEORGE
George is in big trouble....
At Jerry's the next day.

JERRY
You ripped off a Ziggy?

ELAINE
It must've seeped up my subconscious , Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?

JERRY
I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. "The New Yorker is stealing my ideas."
ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
Kramer comes in

ELAINE
Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on ( Kramer turns around to leave)

JERRY
Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this , now she's got nothing.

SALLY
(on TV) Master of Evil Jerry Seinfeld has broke off all contacts with me.

JERRY
That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?

ELAINE
Why are you yelling at the TV?

SALLY
.OK get this; I heard he makes his best friend date women that look just like him.Hello issues..

JERRY
Elaine , have you been talking to her?

ELAINE
Hey! I'm just a fan..ha ha...

SALLY
Oh and speaking of issues. Guess who got a no-polish manicure and begged his
neighbor not to tell anyone?

JERRY
( to Kramer) I thought you stopped talking??

KRAMER
..All right..Starting now......
Credits
Epilogue at Monks

JERRY
You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?

GEORGE
like that ( looking at Jerry)

JERRY
You mean like.. ( points to his hair)
George;..That.

JERRY
So she..

GEORGE
Yes..

JERRY
And you don't...

GEORGE
Nooo...
Jerry; So...

GEORGE
Exactly..

JERRY
Hmmmm...

GEORGE
We...must never ever speak of this again..

JERRY
No , no......( long pause. they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?

GEORGE
Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off ( starts to leave)

JERRY
I think that's for the best.
End.

GEORGE, DRINKING TEA IN HIS APARTMENT WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND
"I-I've given this
a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but we, uh, we have to break up."

MAURA
"No."

GEORGE, AFTER HESITATING
"What's that?"

MAURA
"We're not breaking up."

GEORGE, AFTER HESITATING
"We're not?"

MAURA
"No."

GEORGE, AFTER HESITATING EVEN LONGER
"All right."

JERRY, WITH GEORGE AT MONK'S
"She said no?"

GEORGE
"She said no."

JERRY
"What did you do?"

GEORGE
"What could I do? We fooled around and went to a movie."

JERRY
"George, both parties don't have to consent to a breakup. It's not
like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn
your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your
arguments."

GEORGE
"Well, I don't really like her."

JERRY
"That's good."

GEORGE
"I don't find her attractive."

JERRY
"Solid."

GEORGE
"I'd like to sleep with a lot of other women."

JERRY
"Always popular."

GEORGE
"Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food. 'Oh, Mr. Mashed
Potatoes, you are so good.'"

JERRY
"You have an airtight case."

GEORGE
"And in bed--"

JERRY
"I'm afraid we're out of time."

JERRY, PULLING OUT A JEWELRY CASE
"Hey."

GEORGE
"What?"

JERRY
"Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he
actually wore in the movie Cinderfella. I got 'em at an auction."

GEORGE
"I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you."

JERRY
"No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to
next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him."

GEORGE
"You already have an in. You have the same first name. Jerry."

JERRY
"Oh, that'll intrigue him."

GEORGE
"Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week."

JERRY
"George Peppard has been dead for years."

GEORGE
"Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team."

GLENN, ON THE STREET TALKING WITH ELAINE
"So you would choose your last meal
based on the method of execution?"

ELAINE
"Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for
something hot and spicy. You know, thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection,
feels like pasta. You know, painless, don't want anything to heavy."

GLENN
"So, um, why don't we get together some time?"

ELAINE
"Oh, sure. Why don't you give me your number?"

GLENN
"I think it'd be better if I called you."

ELAINE
"Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. Do-do you work
around here?"

GLENN
"Mmmm... no, not really."

ELAINE
"So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?"

GLENN
"I think you're very beautiful."

ELAINE, LAUGHING
"Oh, ha ha. That'll do."

JERRY, IN HIS APARTMENT WITH ELAINE
"What about Puddy?"

ELAINE
"I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks. I think it might be
over."

JERRY
"So, what's this guy about?"

ELAINE
"I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked.
I'll be he's in a relationship."

JERRY
"Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity. Elaine, you
could be dating the Green Lantern!"

ELAINE
"Which one is he?"

JERRY
"Green suit, power ring."

ELAINE
"I don't care for jewely on men."

KRAMER, ENTERING JERRY'S APARTMENT CARRYING A LARGE BOX
"Hey. It happened
again. Another robbery in the building."

JERRY
"So you bought a cooler?"

KRAMER
"It's a strongbox to protect my irreplacables."

ELAINE
"And... what would those be?"

KRAMER
"Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations. My Tony,
my... military discharge."

JERRY
"You were in the Army?"

KRAMER
"Briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if
somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions."

ELAINE
"Literally."

KRAMER
"'Literally'? What's that supposed to mean? You mind if I hide this
somewhere?"

JERRY
"No, go ahead."

KRAMER, STUTTERING GIBBERISH
"A little... privacy, huh?"

JERRY
"Oh, come on!"

KRAMER
"Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue. Boy, you wouldn't last a
day in the Army."

JERRY, GOING INTO THE HALL WITH ELAINE
"How long did you last?"

KRAMER
"Well, that's classified."

ELAINE, IN THE HALL WITH JERRY
"Hey, what if he's married?"

JERRY
"Kramer?"

ELAINE
"No, the Green Lantern."

KRAMER
"OK!"

JERRY, GOING BACK INSIDE WITH ELAINE
"So, you would date a married guy?
That's so hacky."

ELAINE
"Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I
get."
[Jerry, getting a spoon out of his silverware drawer, accidentally stumbles
on the key, and holds it up for Kramer to see]

KRAMER
"You peeked!"

JERRY
"This is your hiding place?!"

KRAMER
"It was under a spoon!"

GEORGE, IN HIS APARTMENT WITH MAURA
"And so, for all these reasons, we are
officially broken up. Thank you, and good night."

MAURA
"No, George, we're not."

GEORGE
"But I proved it!"

MAURA
"I refuse to give up on this relationship. It's like launching
missiles from a submarine. Both of use have to turn our keys."

GEORGE
"Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key."

MAURA
"I'm sorry, George, I can't do that."

GEORGE
"Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!"

ELAINE, WALKING ON THE STREET WITH GLENN
"So, how is a guy like you not
involved?"

GLENN
"Well, I might ask you the same thing."

ELAINE, IN HER MIND
"That's true, maybe he's not married."
[Glenn gives her a flower]

ELAINE
"Oh, that is so sweet."

ELAINE, IN HER MIND
"How long do I have to hold this?"

GLENN, SEEING A WOMAN ON THE STREET
"Oh, no."

ELAINE
"Who is it?"

GLENN, RUNNING WITH ELAINE INTO AN ALLEY
"Uh, no one, no one. Here, uh, let
me show you a short cut. Come on."

ELAINE, IN HER MIND
"Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower."

ELAINE, ON THE STREET BELOW JERRY'S WINDOW
"Jerry! Jerry!"

JERRY, LOOKING DOWN FROM HIS WINDOW
"Elaine, what are you doin' down there?"

ELAINE
"You didn't hear me buzzing?"

JERRY
"Oh, I guess it's broken."

ELAINE
"Throw down your key."

JERRY
"It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer."

ELAINE
"I'll catch it!"

JERRY
"You'll chicken out at the last second."

ELAINE
"Yeah, you're right."

ELAINE
"All right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody
comes out?"

JERRY
"All right."

JERRY, AFTER A PAUSE
"Hey, you know what's weird?"

ELAINE
"Huh?"

JERRY
"I used to be able to have a huge meal, go right to sleep. But I can't
anymore."

ELAINE
"Nodding off!"

ELAINE
"Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife
with me."

ELAINE, TO A PASSERBY GIVING HER A DIRTY LOOK
"We haven't done anything yet."

ELAINE
"I'm hungry. Can you throw something down?"

JERRY, THROWING DOWN A GRANOLA BAR
"All right. Here!"

JERRY, WALKING AWAY FROM THE WINDOW
"I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer."

ELAINE, FROM THE STREET
"It went in the sewer!"

JERRY, PULLING APART HIS BUZZER AND FINDING THE PROBLEM
"Hey..."

KRAMER, ENTERING JERRY'S APARTMENT AND SEEING HIM AT THE BUZZER BOX
"What
are you doin'?"

JERRY
"You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!"

KRAMER
"You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that
I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know
everything about it. You're so obsessed with me."

JERRY, GOING INTO THE HALLWAY
"I'm gonna go let Elaine in."

KRAMER
"What are you doing with her?"

JERRY, HEARING THE DOOR LOCK BEHIND HIM
"Kramer!"

KRAMER
"Security issue!"

JERRY, SEEING ELAINE WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAY TOWARDS HIM
"Oh, hey. You got
in."

ELAINE, HANDING HIM A LARGE STACK OF PAPERS
"Yeah, flirted with the menu
guy."

JERRY, TAKING THE MENUS
"Oh, thanks."

KRAMER, CLATTERING INSIDE
"That wasn't me!"

JERRY
"So, he's definitely married, huh?"

ELAINE
"Yeah..."

JERRY
"Boy, I would've loved to have been there when you told him off."

ELAINE
"Hmm..."

JERRY
"Oh, come on!"

ELAINE
"Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run."

KRAMER, FROM INSIDE JERRY'S APARTMENT
"OK!"
[Elaine and Jerry go back inside Jerry's apartment]

KRAMER
"All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this
is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement."

GEORGE, FROM THE STREET BELOW JERRY'S WINDOW
"Jerry!"
[George tries to whistle to get Jerry's attention]

JERRY
"George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!"
Jerry, putting on his coat to go downstairs, when he finds the key in his

COAT POCKET
"I believe this belongs to you."

KRAMER
"Heyyyy!"
Jerry, opening the ground floor door for George, and seeing him eating a

GRANOLA BAR
"Where did you get that?"

GEORGE
"I bought it."

PHIL, WALKING UP TO GET INSIDE WITH GEORGE
"Thanks."

JERRY, STARTING TO CLOSE THE DOOR
"I'm sorry. I-I don't know you."

PHIL
"What?"

JERRY
"There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in."

PHIL
"But, I live here. I ran out to get some birdseed, and-and I forgot my
key."

GEORGE
"Sounds like a scam."

JERRY, CLOSING THE DOOR ON PHIL
"Very sorry."

GEORGE, WAITING FOR THE UP ELEVATOR WITH JERRY
"So, I broke up with Maura."

JERRY
"Great, you're lonely and miserable again."

GEORGE
"Feels right."

JERRY
"Is that guy still there?"

GEORGE, LOOKING AT THE DOOR
"He's starin' at us."

JERRY
"Don't look at him."

JERRY, WHEN PHIL STARTS TO KNOCK ON THE DOOR
"We don't hear that."

GEORGE
"Want a bite?"

JERRY
"No, I don't."

GEORGE, IN HIS MIND
"I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke
and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit."

MAURA, COMING IN GEORGE'S APARTMENT
"Hey, Honey."

GEORGE
"What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship,
twice."

MAURA
"George, you didn't mean that. That was just a fight."

GEORGE
"Why does it only seem like I'm the only one working at this breakup?"

MAURA
"George, I listened to your arguments, and they were rambling and
flimsy. I'm not convinced. Come on, get dressed and let's get some dinner."

GEORGE
"All right."

MAURA
"Eww, Mr. Apple. You have a brown spot."

ELAINE, AT GLENN'S SMALL, DINGY APARTMENT WITH HIM
"So, this is your
little... love nest?"

GLENN
"It's nothing special, just a little place I keep."

ELAINE
"Oh."

GLENN
"Ah, should I light a fire?"

ELAINE
"Oh, that sounds romantic."

GLENN, GOING OUTSIDE, THROUGH THE WINDOW
"I'm having a little problem with
the heat. Uh, I got some cardboard out here."

ELAINE, IN HER MIND
"This is wrong. I should go."

GLENN, FROM OUTSIDE
"Can you get that, please?"

ELAINE
"Oh, sure."
[Elaine gasps when she opens the door, seeing the woman from the street that
Glenn had avoided earlier]

LADY
"Where's Glenn?"

ELAINE
"You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm
not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear."

LADY
"Lady, I'm not his wife, I'm his welfare caseworker. Is he home?"

ELAINE
"This is his home?"

LADY
"Yes."

ELAINE
"So, he's..."

LADY
"Poor."

GLENN, COMING BACK THROUGH THE WINDOW CARRYING AN OLD CHAIR
"I think this
will burn!"
Jerry, getting into his building elevator from the lobby, and seeing Phil get

IN WITH HIM
"So you do live here."

PHIL
"Yeah."
[going up in the elevator, both men awkwardly stand in silence]

JERRY, GETTING OFF THE ELEVATOR, AS PHIL IS, TOO
"You live on this floor?"

PHIL
"Yeah."
Jerry, seeing Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from

KRAMER'S
"So you live right... there."

PHIL
"Yeah."

JERRY
"So I guess I'll see--"
[Phil, going into his apartment, slams the door behind him]

ELAINE, WITH JERRY AT MONK'S
"He wouldn't give me his number because he
doesn't have a phone. He's not married. He's poor."

JERRY
"Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels, with the
straps?"

ELAINE
"He probably busted it up and burned it for heat."

JERRY
"So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?"

ELAINE
"How can I end it over money? I feel bad."

JERRY
"Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other
situation?"

ELAINE
"Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage
cans."

JERRY
"Good. How did you handle that?"

ELAINE
"Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley
across the street."

JERRY
"Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean."

ELAINE
"Well, I am not paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship.
Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well,
how much do you think it would be?"

GEORGE, ENTERING MONK'S
"Hey."

JERRY
"Hey, where have you been?"

GEORGE
"Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a
reasonable doubt."

ELAINE
"If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things
would have been so much simpler."

GEORGE
"Who's this, Blue Arrow?"

ELAINE
"Green Lantern."

JERRY
"We found out his super power was lack of money."

ELAINE
"All right."

JERRY
"He's invulnerable to creditors."

ELAINE
"We get it."

JERRY
"He's the 'Got-no-Green' Lantern."

ELAINE
"Thank you."

JERRY
"Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan."

ELAINE, LEAVING
"Well crafted."

GEORGE
"Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura."

JERRY
"Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair."
George, now on the same side as the booth of Jerry, with Elaine's side

VACANT
"She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break
under the cross. I actually have to do it."

JERRY
"Could you move over there?"
[George reluctantly switches sides, so they're facing each other]

GEORGE
"Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a
crush on me."

JERRY
"Really? How come you never pursued her before?"

GEORGE
"She's too tan. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot."

ELAINE, COMING BACK INTO MONK'S
"Did I leave my glasses here?"

JERRY, TO ELAINE
"He can wipe out his checking account in a single bound!"

ELAINE, LEAVING AGAIN
"Keep 'em!"
[Jerry, as he's entering his apartment to see Kramer there, disturbs some
sort of bird in the hallway, which makes a squawking noise]

KRAMER
"Hey."

JERRY
"There's a giant parrot in the hallway."

KRAMER
"It's Phil's."

JERRY
"Who?"

KRAMER
"Our neighbor that you turned against. Anyway, I told him it'd be
fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway."

JERRY
"What'd ya tell him that for?"

KRAMER
"Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been
tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his
place."

JERRY
"Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the
couch?"

KRAMER
"Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at
Phil's"

JERRY
"He let you?"

KRAMER
"No, he doesn't know. So, uh, Phil won't be compulsively looking for
it like some people. You!"
[going out into the hallway, Kramer is apparently attacked by the parrot,
because it starts squawking loudly, and Kramer runs back inside Jerry's place]

GEORGE, ENTERING HIS APARTMENT WITH THE TOO-TAN SECRETARY
"So, you... you
say you've been in the city all winter?"

LORETTA
"I was in Maine for a couple days."

GEORGE
"Well... here we are."

LORETTA
"George, I've always fantasized about jumping into bed with you."

GEORGE
"Ho ho!"

LORETTA
"But... I don't want to spoil things by sleeping with you too soon."

GEORGE
"Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam."

LORETTA
"I want to build something with you, George."

GEORGE
"Oh, not more building."

LORETTA
"And I won't take no for an answer."

GEORGE
"No?"

LORETTA
"No."

GEORGE, AFTER HESITATING
"All right."

ELAINE, IN AN ALLEY WITH GLENN
"So, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?"

GLENN
"It's a surprise."

ELAINE, GIGGLING
"Oh."
[a nearby door opens, and a cook throws a garbage bag out into a trash can;
Glenn immediately goes for the bag]

ELAINE
"What are you doing? What is that?"

GLENN
"It's a bag of donuts."

ELAINE
"It's garbage."

GLENN, LOOKING IN THE BAG
"No, no, no, no, no. When they make the new ones,
the old ones come out right here."

ELAINE, PULLING OUT HER CHECKBOOK
"All right, that's it. How do you spell
your last name?"

GLENN, STILL LOOKING THROUGH THE GARBAGE BAG
"It's a bear claw! You have no
idea how rare this is."

ELAINE
"I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?"

GLENN, EATING THE BEAR CLAW
"Mmm!"

ELAINE
"Make it three hundred."

GLENN, HANDING HER THE BEAR CLAW
"You know, Elaine, you are the bear claw in
the garbage can of my life."

ELAINE, BITING THE BEAR CLAW
"Aw, Glenn."
[the cook comes out again, dumping a bucket of water out in the alley, and
splashing Elaine and Glenn, but they're too wrapped up with each other to
notice]
Jerry, at Phil's door, which is answered by a woman wearing cleaning gloves

AND CARRYING A CLEANING BUCKET
"Hi. Is Phil here?"

PHIL, FROM INSIDE THE APARTMENT
"Yeah, I'm here."

JERRY
"Phil... hi. I-I know we kind of got off to a bad start. But your
bird, which is lovely, by the way, made a mess on my door."

PHIL
"And?"

JERRY
"I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there."

PHIL
"That's my wife."

JERRY, AFTER AN AWKWARD PAUSE
"All right, I think we're done here."

JERRY, IN HIS APARTMENT IN A TUXEDO, WITH GEORGE
"So, you're in a
relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a
woman who won't have sex with you."

GEORGE
"This isn't going well."

JERRY
"I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!"

GEORGE, STARTING TO LEAVE
"You don't need the cufflinks. You have the same
name. Jerry!"

JERRY
"Where are you goin'? Help me look."

GEORGE
"It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a
staged reading of Godspell with the other."

JERRY
"Which is with who?"

GEORGE, LEAVING
"It doesn't matter."

KRAMER, ENTERING JERRY'S APARTMENT, IN HIS OWN TUXEDO
"Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you
clean up nice."

JERRY
"I can't go until I find my cufflinks."

KRAMER
"Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of
your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox."

JERRY
"You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?"

KRAMER, GOING INTO THE HALL WITH JERRY
"Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll
pick up the key."
[in the hall, Jerry and Kramer see Phil and his wife, both crying, going into
their apartment]

KRAMER
"Hey, what's going on?"

PHIL
"Fredo is dead."

JERRY
"That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?"

PHIL
"No! my bird. We just got back from the pet cemetery."

JERRY
"Oh, Phil. Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry."

PHIL
"Oh, I'll bet you are! They told us he was poisoned! Something in his
food."

JERRY
"But I, I didn't--"
[Phil slams the door on Jerry, and Kramer]

JERRY
"Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! And who buries a bird?"

KRAMER
"Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the
incinerator."

JERRY
"Just get the key and let's get out here."

KRAMER
"You know, it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in
Fredo's food dish. Whew! That's a weird coincidence."

JERRY
"Kramer!?"

KRAMER
"What?"

JERRY
"You killed Fredo!"

KRAMER
"Fredo was weak and stupid. He shouldn't've eaten that key."

JERRY
"Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the
key is in the bird. What are we gonna do?"

KRAMER
"You just answered your own question."

JERRY
"Oh, no."

KRAMER, WALKING TOWARDS HIS APARTMENT
"I'll get the shovel."

GEORGE, AT MONK'S WITH LORETTA
"The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some
odd choices."

LORETTA
"What?"

GEORGE
"I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating."

MAURA, ENTERING MONK'S
"George?"

GEORGE
"Maura. Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!"

MAURA
"You told me to meet you here for lunch."

GEORGE, STANDING UP AND OVERREACTING
"Oh, I'm caught in my own web of lies!"

MAURA, TO LORETTA
"I'm Maura."

LORETTA, TO MAURA
"I'm Loretta. You want to join us?"

GEORGE
"This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my
torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three
lives. Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so..."

MAURA
"George, what we have is too important. We can work through this."

LORETTA
"So can we."

GEORGE
"What? So, this is still not over?"

MAURA
"No."

GEORGE
"You?"

LORETTA
"No."

GEORGE, RELUCTANTLY SITTING DOWN
"All right."

GLENN, IN HIS APARTMENT WITH ELAINE
"Elaine, wow, a TV, a stereo?"

ELAINE
"Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em."

GLENN, AS A WOMAN WALKS IN
"Oh, my God, Allison. You're home early."

ELAINE
"Who is this?"

ALLISON
"His wife."

ELAINE
"You're poor and married?"

GLENN
"Looks like it."

ALLISON
"Who the hell are you?"

ELAINE
"I guess I'm Lois Loan."

JERRY, IN THE PET CEMETERY WITH KRAMER
"Kramer, I can't believe we're grave
robbers."

KRAMER, READING A TOMBSTONE
"'Man's best friend.' Jerry, I want something
like that on my tombstone."

JERRY, SEEING FREDO'S TOMBSTONE, AND HANDING THE SHOVEL TO KRAMER
"Oh, my
God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up."

KRAMER
"All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him."

JERRY, TAKING THE SHOEVEL BACK
"I'll dig."

KRAMER
"Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go
check it out."
[as Jerry starts to dig, Kramer, still in his tux, walks off, trips over a
tombstone, and tries to appear dignified again]

JERRY, HITTING METAL WITH THE SHOVEL
"Well, that was easy."

PHIL, WALKING IN THE CEMETERY WITH HIS WIFE, NEAR FREDO'S GRAVE
"All right,
Honey, one last look, then you have to let Fredo rest in peace."

JERRY, PULLING THE METAL BOX OUT OF THE GROUND
"Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up,
now let's cut him open!"

PHIL, SEEING JERRY DIGGING UP THE GRAVE
"Oh, my God!"

'MRS. PHIL'
"Oh!"

JERRY
"Hey, neighbor."

GEORGE, IN JERRY'S APARTMENT WITH KRAMER, JERRY, AND ELAINE
"All right. I'm
gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each."

GEORGE, TO ELAINE
"What do you think?"

ELAINE
"Give me forty, you'll never see me again."
[Elaine flips her tongue at George, who rolls his eyes away]

ELAINE, TO JERRY
"So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are
you gonna move out, or what?"

JERRY
"Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building."

GEORGE, FLIPPING OPEN THE LID OF THE STRONGBOX
"So, what's in the cooler?"

KRAMER
"Oh. Well, would you look at that. Guess I forgot to lock it."

JERRY
"You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for something?"

KRAMER
"Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry? Really one for the
books.
End.

GEORGE
"Keep it real!"

GEORGE
"Let's get nuts!"

GEORGE, AT MONK'S WITH JERRY
"When are they gonna learn that any news about
China is an instant page-turner?"

GEORGE, SEEING JERRY WITH A SMALL BLACK DEVICE
"What's that?"

JERRY
"It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida
for his birthday."

GEORGE
"How much was it?"

JERRY
"Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the
gift. He gets excited about the deal."

GEORGE
"Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?"

JERRY
"Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's
his favorite."

GEORGE
"I got a message from the Rosses at work today."

JERRY
"Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?"

GEORGE
"At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda
felt that they blamed me for Susan's death."

JERRY
"Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly."

ELAINE, ENTERING MONK'S WITH HER BOYFRIEND
"Oh, um... Darryl. These are...
people I know. Jerry, George."

DARRYL
"Nice meeting you. Ah, I gotta run, Elaine. I'll see you later."

ELAINE
"OK."

JERRY
"Still no Puddy?"

ELAINE
"Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well,
what do you think?"

JERRY
"What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?"

ELAINE
"What black guy?"

JERRY
"Darryl. He's black, isn't he?"

ELAINE
"He is?"

GEORGE
"No, he isn't."

JERRY
"Isn't he, Elaine?"

ELAINE
"You think?"

GEORGE
"I thought he looked Irish."

JERRY
"What's his last name?"

ELAINE
"Nelson."

GEORGE
"That's not Irish."

JERRY
"I think he's black."

GEORGE
"Should we be talkin' about this?"

ELAINE
"I think it's OK."

GEORGE
"No, it isn't."

JERRY
"Why not?"

GEORGE
"Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here."

JERRY
"If he's black."

ELAINE
"Is he black?"

JERRY
"Does it matter?"

ELAINE
"No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know."

JERRY
"Oh, so you need to know?"

ELAINE
"No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew."

WAITRESS
"Should I take that?"

JERRY, GETTING OUT HIS WALLET
"Uh, one second."

ELAINE, LOOKING IN HER PURSE
"Oh, here."

GEORGE, PULLING OUT SOME MONEY
"Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah."
[when they see the waitress, who is black, all three hurriedly get out lots
of money for her tip]

GEORGE, WITH JERRY IN HIS APARTMENT, ON THE PHONE
"Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's
George."

MRS. ROSS
"Uh, who?"

GEORGE
"George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak."

MR. ROSS, WALKING BY MRS. ROSS
"We're all out of lime juice. I told that
woman to buy more."

MRS. ROSS
"Uh, George, the Susan Ross Foundation is having an event this
weekend."

GEORGE
"Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got
to get out there this weekend and sign the papers."

MR. ROSS, AGAIN WALKING BY
"I'm goin' back to bed."

MRS. ROSS
"Thank you for calling, George."

GEORGE
"Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta
go."

JERRY
"House in the Hamptons?"

GEORGE
"Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I
figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons."

KRAMER, ENTERING JERRY'S APARTMENT TO FIND JERRY AND GEORGE
"Well."

JERRY
"Hey."

KRAMER
"Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate."

JERRY
"Wow. What are we celebrating?"

KRAMER
"Uh, you remember my coffee table book?"

JERRY
"With the little legs?"

KRAMER
"That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie."

GEORGE
"How are they gonna make that book into a movie?"

KRAMER
"You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?"

GEORGE
"Yeah?"

KRAMER
"Independence Day?"

GEORGE
"Oh."

JERRY
"How much are they payin' you?"

KRAMER
"Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while.
A long while."

JERRY
"That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long
while."

KRAMER
"Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm
retiring."

JERRY
"From what?"

KRAMER
"From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished
everything I've set out to do."

JERRY, SEEING THAT KRAMER HAS A NEW WATCH
"What's that?"

KRAMER
"Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch."

JERRY AND GEORGE
"Ooh!"

KRAMER
"Well, it's not really gold."

JERRY AND GEORGE
"Aww."
[approaching Darryl's apartment, Elaine hears loud rap music being played,
and smiles knowingly]

ELAINE, AS DARRYL OPENS HIS DOOR
"Hey."

DARRYL
"Hey."

ELAINE
"Great music."

DARRYL
"Oh, it's my neighbor. They blast that stuff twenty four hours a day.
I hate it."

DARRYL
"Yo, you! Turn it down!"

ELAINE
"Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?"

DARRYL
"They're... African."

ELAINE
"Right. African."

DARRYL
"Well, not Africa, actually. South Africa."

ELAINE
"South Africa."

DARRYL
"My family used to live there, but, uh, we got out years ago, for
obvious reasons. You know how it is."

ELAINE
"Maybe."

GEORGE, TO A STREET VENDER SELLING HOT DOGS
"You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or
else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this."
[the Rosses come out of a nearby building onto the street, observe George not
being in the Hamptons, and move on]

GEORGE
"I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs
all the time."

VENDER
"Are you gonna buy a hot dog or not?"

GEORGE
"Mmm... no."

MORTY, IN FLORIDA, AS JERRY COMES OUT OF HIS ROOM, HAVING JUST WOKEN UP
"Rise and shine, sleepy head! Ha ha!"

JERRY
"It's 5:30 in the morning!"

HELEN
"We let you sleep in."

JERRY, HANDING HIS DAD A GIFT
"Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a
birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday."

MORTY
"Aw, Jerry. I should be buyin' you presents."

JERRY
"What does that mean?"

HELEN
"Leave your father alone. It's his birthday."

MORTY
"Oooh! Heh heh! It's a radar detector."

JERRY
"Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour.
You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard
organizer."

MORTY
"This looks like too much money."

JERRY
"Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks."

MORTY
"You think it's hot?"

JERRY
"Could be."

MORTY
"Attaboy! Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!"

HELEN
"I'm right here."

JERRY
"And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a
calculator."

MORTY
"So, I can use it in the restaurant to figure out the tip?"

JERRY
"Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner."

MORTY
"Helen, we got into restaurants and figure out the tips."

HELEN
"Jerry, you're getting your father too excited."

KRAMER, ENTERING THE CONDO, AND GOING TO THE FRIDGE AS IF HE'S A NEIGHBOR
"Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?"

JERRY
"Kramer, what are you doing here?"

KRAMER
"I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door."

HELEN
"Mr. Kornstein died, and it's a beautiful apartment."

KRAMER
"Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it."

JERRY
"Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die."

JERRY, GETTING LOOKS FROM HIS PARENTS
"Not you. Older people."

HELEN
"Don't eat cookies for breakfast! I'll fix you something. How 'bout a
feta cheese omelette?"

KRAMER
"Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom."

JERRY
"If you feed him, he'll never leave."

HELEN
"We don't have any feta. How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?"

KRAMER, IMMATURELY
"I guess."

JERRY
"I can't believe this."

KRAMER
"I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?"

ELAINE, WITH GEORGE AT MONK'S
"So, George, do you have any thoughts on this
Darryl situation?"

GEORGE
"Actually, I did have a thought."

ELAINE
"Oh."

GEORGE
"Why don't you just ask him?"

ELAINE, RUDELY AND GIVING HIM A 'DUH' LOOK
"Because, if I ask him, then it's
like I really want to know."

GEORGE
"Maybe he's, um... mixed."

ELAINE
"Is that the right word?"

GEORGE
"I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this."

ELAINE
"Yeah."

GEORGE, STANDING UP
"I'm just gonna go to the bathroom."

ELAINE, STARTING TO LEAVE
"You know what, I'm leavin'."

GEORGE
"Yeah."

ELAINE
"I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back."

ELAINE, SEEING THE ROSSES ENTERING MONK'S
"Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross."

MRS. ROSS
"Oh, you're George's friend."

MR. ROSS
"We saw him in the city this weekend. Uh, what happened to his
place in the Hamptons?"

ELAINE, LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY
"The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I
don't think so. Have a good one."

GEORGE
"Rosses."

MR. ROSS
"George, we were just talking about you."

GEORGE
"Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of
those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about."

MRS. ROSS
"Really?"

GEORGE
"Yeah, I may move out there."

GEORGE, GETTING 'YEAH, RIGHT' GLANCES FROM THE ROSSES
"I mean it, I'll do
it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!"

MORTY, EATING LUNCH WITH HELEN AND JERRY
"Another fine meal, and now for my
Wizard tip calculator."

JERRY
"Dad, it's got lots of other functions."

MORTY
"Don't worry. I'll get to the other functions."

MORTY, TRYING TO OPEN IT
"I can't get it open."
[Jerry easily opens it]

HELEN
"Yay! Jerry got it open."

MORTY
"The service was slow. And God forbid they should refill the water.
How does 12.4% sound?"

JERRY, LOOKING AT THE WIZARD
"Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six
point six six six six cents."

MORTY
"We'll round down."

HELEN
"Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here on your father's
birthday. You've helped take his mind off the condo elections."

JERRY
"Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were
impeached at the other condo."

MORTY
"I was never impeached! I resigned!"

HELEN
"Even so, the press would bury him!"

JERRY
"What press?"

HELEN
"The condo newsletter, the Boca Breeze."

MORTY
"Pinko Commie rag."

OLD MAN, COMING UP TO THE THREE SEINFELDS
"Hey, Morty. Your boy here, he
just got a date with that young aquacise instructor."

JERRY
"She's fifty."

OLD MAN
"You know what he's got? He's got charisma. That's my man."

KRAMER
"All right, I'll see you guys."

OLD MAN
"Yeah."

KRAMER
"Yeah."
[Kramer, scanning the scene, is surprised to see Morty, right next to him,
staring at his face]

KRAMER, TAPING MORTY'S GLASSES
"Morty, what're you lookin' at?"

MORTY
"I'll tell you what I'm looking at: the next condo president of Del
Boca Vista, Phase Three."

KRAMER
"Hmm."

DARRYL, WITH ELAINE IN HIS APARTMENT
"Elaine, thank you for the Wizard!"
[Elaine laughts somewhat awkwardly]

DARRYL
"Wow, it's got so many functions."

ELAINE
"Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty
information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball..."

DARRYL
"Well, I don't do that stuff."

ELAINE
"It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh,

HERE'S ONE
race."

DARRYL
"Isn't that optional?"

ELAINE
"It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really
would like to know."

DARRYL
"All right, I'm... Asian."

ELAINE
"What?"

DARRYL
"Just to mess with 'em."

ELAINE
laughing awkwardly: "Oh. Right. Good one."

DARRYL
"Average income, uh... over a hundred thousand."

ELAINE
"Really?"

DARRYL
"Does that matter?"

ELAINE
"No, but... it is very nice to know."

JERRY, IN HIS PARENT'S CONDO, ON THE PHONE WITH ELAINE
"So did you figure
out Darryl's... you know."

ELAINE, IN JERRY'S APARTMENT
"Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a
bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way."

JERRY, AS KRAMER WALKS BY
"You're a master of race relations."

ELAINE
"Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?"

JERRY
"Yeah, it's all my father's doing."
[Kramer, apparently looking for something to do, mumbles to Jerry to hand him
a magazine from the table]

JERRY
"He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power
from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse."

ELAINE
"Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?"

JERRY
"Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair."

GEORGE, ENTERING JERRY'S APARTMENT
"Jerry?"

ELAINE, TO GEORGE
"He's still down with his folks."

GEORGE, TO ELAINE
"What are you doin' here?"

JERRY, OVERHEARING THE OTHER TWO
"Elaine, Elaine--"

ELAINE, TO GEORGE
"I'm gettin' his mail."

JERRY, OVERHEARING THE OTHER TWO
"Oh, no."

GEORGE, TO ELAINE
"He asked you to get the mail?"

ELAINE, TO GEORGE
"Mm-hmm."

GEORGE, TAKING THE PHONE FROM ELAINE
"Jerry, why is Elaine getting your
mail?"

JERRY
"George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you
to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and
leak."

ELAINE, TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
"What?"

GEORGE
"What about the mail?"

JERRY
"This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George."

GEORGE, HANGING UP
"All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya."

GEORGE, WITH ELAINE IN JERRY'S APARTMENT
"So, I ran into the Rosses again."

ELAINE
"Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you
have a place in the Hamptons?"

GEORGE
"From me."

ELAINE
"What did you say?"

GEORGE
"I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?"

ELAINE
"I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed."

GEORGE
"So, they knew? Those liars!"

ELAINE
"But you lied first."

GEORGE
"Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they
never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying.
You call them a liar!"

ELAINE
"Like you're a liar!"

GEORGE
"Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?"

ELAINE
"So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over."

GEORGE
"Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting
them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks
first."

ELAINE
"Haven't you done enough to these people?"

GEORGE
"This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise
Jerry's gaskets."
[Elaine gets a sarcastic, 'oh, boy' expression]

KRAMER, TO A ROOM
"Vote for Kramer."

KRAMER, TO A MAN WALKING BY
"Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president.
I'd like your vote. Thanks."

KRAMER, TO AN OLD WOMAN
"Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for
Kramer."

OLD WOMAN
"Will you cut my meat?"

KRAMER
"Gladly."

WAITRESS, TO DARRYL, WHO'S WITH ELAINE AT MONK'S
"Coffee?"

DARRYL
"Sure."

WAITRESS, TO DARRYL
"Are you black? Or should I bring some cream."

DARRYL
"I'm black."

DARRYL, RE-THINKING
"Oh, you know what? Bring a little cream."

DARRYL, SEEING A COUPLE GESTURING TOWARDS HIM AND ELAINE
"Did you hear that?"

ELAINE
"What?"

DARRYL
"God, there are still people who have trouble with an interracial
couple."

ELAINE
"Interracial? Us?"

DARRYL
"Isn't that unbelievable!?"

ELAINE
"Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple.
That is racism!"

DARRYL
"I don't feel like eating."

ELAINE
"Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club."

GEORGE
"So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons."

MRS. ROSS
"Sounds grand."

GEORGE
"Do you have your bathing suits?"

MR. ROSS
"It's March."

GEORGE
"Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive.
Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All
right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!"

JERRY, IN HIS PARENT'S CONDO, TO HIS FATHER, WHO'S IN ANOTHER ROOM
"Hey,
Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take
a vitamin."

JERRY, AS KRAMER COMES WALKING OUT IN A RETIREMENT-LIKE ATHLETIC SWEATSUIT
"Dad, you look so different."

KRAMER
"Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must
walk among them."

MORTY, COMING INTO THE HALL
"This is the home stretch. Tomorrow's the
election!"

KRAMER
"Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then
when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m."

JERRY
"You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily
planner."

MORTY
"Daily what?"

HELEN, COMING INTO THE CONDO
"Have you read today's Boca Breeze?"

KRAMER, LOOKING AT THE NEWSLETTER
"Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh?"

KRAMER, READING OUT LOUD
"Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in
clubhouse."

MORTY
"Barefoot in the clubhouse? Don't you realize this is against the
rules."

KRAMER
"Well, I couldn't find my shoes."

JERRY
"Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down
here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules."

HELEN
"Who wants hot chocolate?"

KRAMER
"Oh, yeah! Me."

MORTY
"This is a huge scandal! We need damage control."

KRAMER
"All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?"

JERRY
"Wizards!"

KRAMER
"Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the
condo board."

JERRY
"Kramer..."

MORTY
"There are twenty people on the board. Thank God you can get that
deal."

KRAMER
"Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next,
Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?"

MORTY, RUSHING TO HIS BEDROOM
"First, I need a nap."

HELEN, RUNNING AFTER HIM
"Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!"

JERRY
"Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards."

KRAMER
"Well, what about your deal, huh?"

JERRY
"I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I
do?"

KRAMER
"Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy."

JERRY
"Down here?"

KRAMER
"Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father."

GEORGE, DRIVING IN THE CAR WITH THE ROSSES
"And that leads into the master
bedroom."

MRS. ROSS
"Tell us more."

GEORGE
"You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium."

MR. ROSS
"Another solarium?"

GEORGE
"Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?"

MR. ROSS
"What are their names?"

GEORGE
"Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?"

MRS. ROSS
"Oh, look, an antique stand. Pull over. We'll buy you a
housewarming gift."

GEORGE, CHUCKLING TO HIMSELF
"Housewarming gift."

GEORGE, SWERVING THE CAR TO GO TO THE ANTIQUE STAND
"All right, we're taking
it up a notch!"

WAITRESS AT MONK'S, HANDING ELAINE A MENU
"Here you go."

ELAINE, TO THE BLACK WAITRESS
"Long day?"

WAITRESS
"Yeah, I just worked a triple shift."

ELAINE
"I hear ya, Sister."

WAITRESS
"Sister?"

ELAINE, AS DARRYL COMES INTO MONK'S
"Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black.
Here he is. See?"

DARRYL
"Hi, Elaine."

ELAINE
"Hey."

WAITRESS
"He's black?"

ELAINE
"Yeah."

DARRYL
"I'm black?"

ELAINE
"Aren't you?"

WAITRESS, LEAVING
"I'll give you a couple minutes to decide."

DARRYL
"What are you talking about?"

ELAINE
"You're black. You said we were an interracial couple."

DARRYL
"We are. Because you're Hispanic."

ELAINE
"I am?"

DARRYL
"Aren't you?"

ELAINE
"No. Why would you think that?"

DARRYL
"Your name's Benes, your hair, and you kept taking me to those
Spanish restaurants."

ELAINE
"That's because I thought you were black."

DARRYL
"Why would you take me to a Spanish restaurant because I'm black?"

ELAINE
"I don't think we should be talking about this."

DARRYL
"So, what are you?"

ELAINE
"I'm white."

DARRYL
"So, we're just a couple of white people?"

ELAINE
"I guess."

DARRYL
"Oh."

ELAINE
"Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?"

DARRYL, LEAVING WITH ELAINE
"Sure."

KRAMER, HAVING LUNCH WITH JERRY AND HIS PARENTS
"Oh, well... I handed out
all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got
this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman,
he won't be leavin' any tips where he is."

JERRY
"Aw."

MORTY
"Congratulations, Mr. President."

KRAMER
"Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master."

OLD MAN
"Hey, Morty, what's wrong with these tip calculators?"

MORTY
"What are you talking about?"

OLD MAN
"It's overtipping. I just left five bucks for a BLT."

MORTY
"This isn't a Wizard, it's a Willard."

JERRY
"A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me!"

OLD MAN #2
"Mine doesn't have a seven!"

OLD MAN #3
"I'm ruined!"

MORTY
"Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?"

JERRY
"Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars."

MORTY
"You didn't have a deal?"

JERRY
"No deal. Not hot."

OLD MAN
"Morty, you, and Kramer, you're finished."

KRAMER
"What?"

OLD MAN
"Everyone vote for the guy in the wheelchair."

KRAMER, GETTING UP TO LEAVE
"Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it
for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York."

JERRY
"Dad, I'm sorry."

MORTY
"You should be! How could you spend two hundred dollars on a tip
calculator?!"

JERRY
"It does other things!"

MR. ROSS, WITH HIS WIFE AND GEORGE, ON A BEACH
"Where are we, George?"

GEORGE
"Almost there."

MR. ROSS
"Well, this is the end of Long Island. Where's your house?"

GEORGE
"We, uh, we go on foot from here."

MR. ROSS
"All right."

GEORGE
"There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no
Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium."

MR. ROSS
"We know."

GEORGE
"Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why
didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?"

MRS. ROSS
"We don't like you, George."

MR. ROSS
"And we always blamed you for what happened to Susan."

GEORGE
"Oh."

MR. ROSS
"All right! Let's head back."
End.
First scene.
Elaine is getting ready to drive Puddy's car, he's giving her last minute
instructions.

PUDDY
Alright, be careful with the car, babe.

ELAINE
Yeah, yeah.

PUDDY
And don't move the seat, I got it right where I like it.

ELAINE
Goodbye?

PUDDY
Two and ten, babe.

ELAINE
Okay.

PUDDY
Don't peel out.

ELAINE
I won't.

ELAINE PEELS OUT AND TURNS ON THE CAR STEREO. SHE HEARS
"Jesus is one, Jesus
is all, Jesus picks me up when I fall..." Elaine changes the stations but all
of the presets are set to religious radio stations; "And he said unto
Abraham...", "Amen! Amen!", "So we pray...", "Saved!", "Jey-sus!" She turns
off the radio.

ELAINE
Jesus?
New scene.
Meeting at George's office. His Boss, Mr. Kruger, is speaking.

KRUGER
According to our latest quarterly thing,Kruger Industrial Smoothing is
heading into the red. Or the black, or whatever the bad one is. Any thoughts?

GEORGE
Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent
check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.

KRUGER
Works for me. Good thinking, George.

CO-WORKER 1
Alright, George.

CO-WORKER 2
Way to go man.

GEORGE
Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend
we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."

KRUGER
Are you done? Silly voices, c'mon people, let's get real.

CO-WORKER 1
Good one.

CO-WORKER 2
That was bad.
New scene.
George and Jerry are at the coffee shop.

GEORGE
I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.

JERRY
And then?

GEORGE
I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a
meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.

JERRY
Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and
walk off.

GEORGE
I can't just leave.

JERRY
That's the way they do it in Vegas.

GEORGE
You never played Vegas.

JERRY
I hear things.
Elaine enters and has a seat.

ELAINE
Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio
were Christian rock stations.

GEORGE
I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real
musicians who think they're so cool and hip.

ELAINE
So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?

JERRY
It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.

ELAINE
Yes, he is lazy.

JERRY
Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.

ELAINE
Yes, he is dumb.

JERRY
So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?

ELAINE
Dumb and lazy, I understand.

GEORGE
Tell you how you could check.

ELAINE
How?

GEORGE
Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The
old switcheroo.

JERRY
No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it
with the other person's.

GEORGE
No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.

JERRY
Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio
did to her.

GEORGE
Well that's the gist of it!

ELAINE
Quiet! So where is this Sophie?

JERRY
Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.

ELAINE
How long have you two been together?

JERRY
I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?

ELAINE AND GEORGE
Nah.
Jerry leaves to go meet Sophie by the register.

GEORGE
By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?

ELAINE
I needed to move a bureau.
New scene.
Kramer and Mickey enter Jerry's apartment.

KRAMER
Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?

MICKEY
Hey Jerry.

JERRY
Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.

KRAMER
Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should
sound like that, something like that.

MICKEY
Aah-choo.

KRAMER
A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.

JERRY
What's with the fake sneezing?

KRAMER
Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to
help the students practice diagnosing.

MICKEY
They assign you a specific disease and you act out the symptoms. It's
an easy gig.

JERRY
Do medical schools actually do this?

KRAMER
Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.

KRAMER AND MICKEY
HUAAHHH!!

JERRY
I think the phone is ringing.

KRAMER AND MICKEY
HUAAHHH!!

JERRY
Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with
that stuff?

KRAMER
Mickey, DTs.
Kramer and Mickey exit, shaking, while Jerry answers the phone.

JERRY
Hello?

SOPHIE
Hey. It's me.

JERRY
Elaine?

SOPHIE
No, it's me.

JERRY
George??

SOPHIE
Jerry, it's Sophie. I can't believe you don't recognize my voice.

JERRY
Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
Kramer enters.

KRAMER
You got any Ipecac?

JERRY
Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.

KRAMER
No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.

JERRY
Did he overdose?

KRAMER
No, it's just too much.
New scene.
Office meeting at Kruger Industrial Smoothing.

KRUGER
..And it gets worse. The team working on the statue in Lafayette
Square kind of over-smoothed it. They ground the head down to about the size of
a softball, and that spells trouble.

GEORGE
Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a
pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?
Everyone at the meeting breaks out in laughter.

GEORGE (GETTING UP AND LEAVING)
Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight
everybody.
New scene.
Mt. Sanai Hospital, a woman in a lab coat is handing out envelopes to a group of
people, Mickey and Kramer included.

DR. WEXLER
In your packet you will find the disease you have been assigned and
the symptoms you will need to exhibit.

MICKEY
Bacterial Meningitis. Jackpot!

KRAMER
Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?

MICKEY
Sorry buddy, this is the "Hamlet" of diseases. Severe pain, nausea,
delusions, it's got everything.

KRAMER (TO THE MAN BESIDE HIM)
Howbout you, do you wanna trade?

MAN
Sure.

KRAMER
Okay, what do you got?

MAN
The surgeon left a sponge inside me.

KRAMER
Good luck with that.
New scene.
George and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.

GEORGE
I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.

JERRY
What did you do the rest of the day?

GEORGE
I saw "Titanic". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?

JERRY
And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
Elaine enters.

ELAINE
Hello boys.

GEORGE
Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?

ELAINE
I did.

GEORGE
And the Christian rock?

ELAINE
Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!

GEORGE
Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?

JERRY
No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?

ELAINE
Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel
misled.

GEORGE
I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.

JERRY
I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.

ELAINE
"It's me?" Isn't it a little premature?

JERRY
I thought so.

ELAINE
Hah. She's not a "me". I'm a "me".

GEORGE
I'm against all "it's me"s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's
like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!
Kramer enters.

KRAMER
Well, I got gonorrhea.

ELAINE
That seems about right.

KRAMER
That's what they gave me.

GEORGE
They? The Government?

JERRY
No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose
it.

KRAMER
And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he
got bacterial meningitis.

GEORGE
I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.
The other three start laughing.

GEORGE (LEAVING)
Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.

ELAINE
What was that?

JERRY
Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.

KRAMER
See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.

JERRY
Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back
row.

KRAMER
Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the
gonorrhea themselves.
New scene.
Mt. Sanai Hospital. Kramer is on the table surrounded by med students.

STUDENT #1
And are you experiencing any discomfort?

KRAMER
Just a little burning during urination.

STUDENT #1
Okay, any other pain?

KRAMER
The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) 
Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met
across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. 
Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we
danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would
experience soon afterwards.

STUDENT #1
Gonorrhea?!

KRAMER
Gonorrhea!
The lab breaks out in spontaneous applause as Mickey turns up the lights and
Kramer takes a bow.
New scene.
Jerry and George are back at Jerry's apartment. Jerry is checking his phone
messages.

JERRY
One message. Hope it's not from you.

ANSWERING MACHINE
"Hey Jerry, it's me. Call me back."

JERRY
Sophie.

GEORGE
She's still doing that?

JERRY
Yep.

GEORGE
Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the
"it's me", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.

JERRY
I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".

GEORGE
What the hell is a gander, anyway?

JERRY (PICKING UP THE PHONE AND DIALING)
It's a goose that's had the old
switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.

SOPHIE
Hey Raef.

JERRY (TO GEORGE)
She thinks it's someone named Raef.

GEORGE
Good, let her think it.

JERRY (INTO THE PHONE, WITH A DISGUISED VOICE)
So, what's going on?

SOPHIE
Not a lot.

GEORGE
Ask about you, ask about you.

JERRY
So, uh, how are things with Jerry?

SOPHIE
Oh, I really like him but, well, I still haven't told him the tractor
story.

JERRY
Right, right, the tractor story.

SOPHIE
Are you sick, Raef? You sound kinda funny.

JERRY
I sound funny?

GEORGE
Abort! Abort!

JERRY
Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What
drives me to take chances like that?

GEORGE
That was very real.

JERRY
She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.

GEORGE
Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?

JERRY
Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?
New scene.
Elaine and Puddy are at Puddy's apartment.

ELAINE
So where do you wanna eat?

PUDDY
Feels like an Arby's night.

ELAINE
Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?

PUDDY
Yes.

ELAINE
Oh. So, you're pretty religious?

PUDDY
That's right.

ELAINE
So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?

PUDDY
Not for me.

ELAINE
Why not?

PUDDY
I'm not the one going to hell.
New scene.
Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.

GEORGE
You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.

JERRY
No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're
dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.

GEORGE
Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?

JERRY
No, she looks completely normal.

GEORGE
Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor
accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.

JERRY
You think she's got toes for thumbs?

GEORGE
How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too
firm?

JERRY
I don't know.

GEORGE
Hands a little smelly?

JERRY
Why do I seek your counsel?
Elaine walks in.

ELAINE
Well I'm going to hell.

JERRY
That seems about right.

ELAINE
According to Puddy.

JERRY
Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and
the doughtnuts and--

ELAINE
I'm not in the mood.

GEORGE (TO A PASSING WAITRESS)
I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.

JERRY
What do you care? You don't believe in hell.

ELAINE
I know, but he does.

JERRY
So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of
your soul.

ELAINE
Well, relationships are very important to me.

JERRY
Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for
all eternity.

GEORGE (TO THE WAITRESS BRINGING HIS DOUGHNUT)
And a slice of devil's food
cake.
New scene.
Kruger's office. George enters, seeing nobody but Mr. Kruger.

GEORGE
Hey. Where is everyone?

MR. KRUGER
They're all off the project. They were boring. George, you are my
main man.

GEORGE
I am?

MR. KRUGER
I don't know what it is, I can't put my finger on it, but lately
you have just seemed 'on'. And you always leave me wanting more.

GEORGE
This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and
folders.

MR. KRUGER
Ah, I'm not too worried about it. Let's get started.

GEORGE
Okay.

MR. KRUGER
George? Check it out. (He begins to spin around in his chair)
Three times around, no feet.

GEORGE
And?

MR. KRUGER
All me.
New scene.
Kramer and Mickey are back at Mt. Sinai.

DR. WEXLER
Alright, and here are you ailments for this week. By the way, Mr.
Kramer, you were excellent.

KRAMER
Oh, thank you.

MICKEY
Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! Alright I get to wear make-up! 
What did you get?

KRAMER
Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had
gonorrhea last week.

DR. WEXLER
Oh, it's no mistake. We loved what you did with it.

KRAMER
I don't believe this, I'm being typecast.
New scene.
Jerry and Sophie are at Jerry's playing chess.

SOPHIE
I move my knight... here. Check.

JERRY
They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe
they should change it to a tractor.

SOPHIE
Jerry, are you embarrassed that you're losing?

JERRY
Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the
farm.

SOPHIE
Bought the farm?

JERRY
Tractor!

SOPHIE
This is an odd side of you, Jerry. I feel uncomfortable.

JERRY
Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle.
Sophie drops her purse and when she bends down to pick it up, Jerry nods
knowingly.
New scene.
Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.

GEORGE
A scar?

JERRY
A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?

GEORGE
A tractor.

JERRY
I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about
it.

GEORGE
I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe
thumbs.

JERRY
She doesn't have toe thumbs.

GEORGE
Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--

JERRY
Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?

GEORGE
Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for
hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep
creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he
finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George
sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. 
This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who
said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?

MR. KRUGER
I'm not too worried about it.

GEORGE
Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in
your shoebox?

MR. KRUGER
Alright, alright I'm going.

GEORGE (TO JERRY)
Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?

JERRY
Never.
New scene.
Elaine's hallway. The door opens, Puddy steps out in his bathrobe. There's a
newspaper in front of the door across from Elaine's.

PUDDY
Elaine, they forgot to deliver your paper today. Why don't you just
grab that one.

ELAINE
'Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.

PUDDY
C'mon, get it.

ELAINE
Well if you want it, you get it.

PUDDY
Sorry, thou shalt not steal.

ELAINE
Oh, but it's ok for me?

PUDDY
What do you care, you know where you're going.

ELAINE
Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.

PUDDY
Nah.

ELAINE
C'mon.

PUDDY
Alright, what did I do?

ELAINE
David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils
and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I
mean, what do you think about all that?

PUDDY
Gonna be rough.

ELAINE
Uh, you should be trying to save me!

PUDDY
Don't boss me! This is why you're going to hell.

ELAINE
I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should
care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.

PUDDY
You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?

ELAINE
Yeah, that's right!
Elaine places her hands beside her head, index fingers raised as 'horns' and she
emits a gutteral growling sound.
New scene.
Mt Sanai Hospital. The actors are gathered. Mickey is practicing his part.

MICKEY
Oh, my liver! Why did I drink all those years? Why did I look for
love in a bottle?

DR. WEXLER
Mr. Kramer? You're up.
Kramer walks in, his face is noticably yellow.

MICKEY
Wait a minute. You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?

KRAMER
Well, we'll see.

STUDENT #2
So, what seems to be bothering you today, Mr. Kramer?

KRAMER (PULLING A LIQUOR BOTTLE FROM HIS JACKET POCKET)
Well, I guess it
started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the
only friend I had left.

MICKEY
Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! (he jumps
Kramer) You wanna be sick? I'll make you sick.
They fall to the floor, wrestling.

STUDENT #2
Cirrhosis of the liver and PCP addiction?
New scene.
Elaine and Puddy have gone to see a priest, Father Curtis.

FATHER CURTIS
Let me see if I understand this. You're concerned that he isn't
concerned that you're going to hell. And you feel that she's too bossy.

ELAINE AND PUDDY
Yeah, that's right.

FATHER CURTIS
Well, oftentimes in cases of inter-faith marriages, couples have
difficulty--

ELAINE (INTERRUPTING)
Woah, woah, woah! No one's getting married here.

FATHER CURTIS
You aren't?

PUDDY
No.

ELAINE
We're just, you know, having a good time.

FATHER CURTIS
Oh, well then it's simple. You're both going to hell.

PUDDY
No way, this is bogus, man!

ELAINE
Well, thank you father.

FATHER CURTIS
Oh, did you hear the one about the new guy in hell who's talkng
to the devil by the coffee machine?

PUDDY
I'm really not in the mood, I'm going to hell.

ELAINE
Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.
Elaine makes the same 'fingers up' devil gesture as she did in her apartment and
Father Curtis joins in.
New scene.
Jerry and Sophie ar at Jerry's apartment.

SOPHIE
You know, Jerry, there's this thing that I haven't told you about. 
See, there was this tractor and, oh boy, this is really difficult.

JERRY
Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.

SOPHIE
How could you know?
Jerry (putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to

SOPIE'S)
Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not
gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and
meaningful relationship.
Kramer and Mickey barge in, they're in the middle of an argument.

KRAMER
..I didn't say that, no.

MICKEY
You gave me gonorrhea, you didn't even tell me!

KRAMER
Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun
with it.

JERRY
Hey, hey! I'm with someone.

KRAMER
Oh. Hello.

SOPHIE
No, I understand. This could be a tough thing to deal with. The
important thing is that you have a partner who's supportive.

KRAMER (TO MICKEY)
You know? She's right.

SOPHIE
Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner. I got gonorrhea from a
tractor.

JERRY
You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor
story??

KRAMER
You can't get it from that.

SOPHIE
But I did. My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea from riding the tractor
in my bathing suit.

JERRY (WALKING OUT)
Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight
everybody.
New scene.
Mr. Kruger and George are burning the midnight oil. George is working, Mr.
Kruger is bouncing a ball against the wall and catching it. George is
percolating.

GEORGE
Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?

MR. KRUGER
You seem like you've got a pretty good handle on it.

GEORGE
No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your
name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and
all it says now is K-uger!

MR. KRUGER
K-uger, that sounds like one of those old-time car horns, huh? 
K-uger! K-uger!

GEORGE
Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!

MR. KRUGER (GETTING UP TO LEAVE)
Thank you George, you've been great. That's
it for me.

GEORGE
Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!

MR. KRUGER
It's K-uger!

GEORGE
No! No!

MR. KRUGER
Goodnight everybody!
End.

[SETTING
Bookstore]
(George and Jerry both enter a bookstore)

GEORGE
I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.

JERRY
First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
(Kramer walks up to Jerry and George while leafing through a book)

KRAMER
Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..

JERRY
(Sarcastic) You better hurry.

GEORGE
I'm gonna hit the head.

KRAMER
Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.

JERRY
(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
(George is about to go into the bathroom. He grabs a book on his way in)

KRAMER
Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.

JERRY
She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?

KRAMER
(Remembering) No, that wasn't dancing.

JERRY
(Pointing) Hey, there's Leo.

KRAMER
Oh? Who's Leo?

JERRY
Uncle Leo.

KRAMER
Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..
(Kramer and Jerry both watch Leo looking at the books on a shelf. Then, Leo takes a book and puts it under his coat)

JERRY
Did I just see that?!

KRAMER
(To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
The Annual Peterman Party]
(Elaine is sitting alone at a table. Walter, a co-worker, comes up to her)

WALTER
(Joking around with her) So, Elaine.. are you going to dance this year?

ELAINE
Maybe.. All over your face!
(A waiter serving food approaches Elaine)

WAITER
If you do dance, the cooks want to know - so they can be brought out of the kitchen. They missed it last year.
(Elaine is looking both angry and embarrassed. Scene cuts to Peterman giving a toast)

PETERMAN
My friends, a toast. As the wolly-haired Melanasians of Papua, New Guinea once said, (Makes a series of clicking and popping sounds. The music
starts up) All right! Who's dancing? (No one makes a gesture that they intend to dance) No one? Alright, I'll just have to get things started. (Grabs a female
employee, and starts dancing with her. The crowd is impressed)
(Scene cuts back to Elaine's table. A fellow employee sits down at Elaine's table)

ZACH
Hi, I'm Zach.

ELAINE
Hi, I'm miserable. (They both laugh)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Bookstore]
(George casually puts the large book he took into the bathroom with him on the shelf. A manager notices, and approaches him)

MANAGER
Excuse me, Sir. What are you doing?

GEORGE
(Acting innocent) I'm all set.

MANAGER
(Pointing) Did you take that book with you into the bathroom?

GEORGE
(Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear?
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
The Coffee shop]
(George and Jerry are at Monk's Coffee shop)

GEORGE
They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there
would be no books.

JERRY
(Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.

GEORGE
They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!

JERRY
(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?

GEORGE
I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-

JERRY
(Cutting him off) Thank you very much.

GEORGE
Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?

JERRY
I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.

GEORGE
(Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!
(Elaine enters and sits down)

JERRY
Sleeping in the caragain?

ELAINE
Cocktail flu.

JERRY
(Remembering) Oh, right. The big party..

GEORGE
You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?

ELAINE
(Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..

GEORGE
You went home with him?

ELAINE
Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!

JERRY
(Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?

ELAINE
(Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?

JERRY
(Confused) What's your position?

ELAINE
I am an associate.

GEORGE
Hey, me too.
(A waitress, passing their table, speaks up)

WAITRESS
Yeah, me too.

ELAINE
Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.

GEORGE
Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating.

ELAINE
(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.

JERRY
(Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.

ELAINE
(Sarcastic) Oh, bravo.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry enters his apartment to find Newman and Kramer having a conference at his table)

JERRY
(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?

KRAMER
(Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten.

NEWMAN
(Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you can clear some of this stuff out of the way.

KRAMER
Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!

JERRY
(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.

KRAMER
Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..

JERRY
(Still skeptical) No, he doesn't.

NEWMAN
He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!

JERRY
Yes, it can.

KRAMER
We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!

NEWMAN
It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt or dander of the equine.

JERRY
So, who's gonna pull this thing?
(Kramer and Newman both look at eachother)

KRAMER
(To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would.

NEWMAN
Yeah, but I though-

KRAMER
(Stopping his thought) Da-da-da-da no.

JERRY
(Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?

KRAMER
(Brainstorming) What about the homeless?

NEWMAN
Can't we worry about them later?

KRAMER
(Explaining) To pull the rickshaw.

NEWMAN
(Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate knowledge of the street..

KRAMER
They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!

JERRY
(Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
The Coffee shop]
(Uncle Leo enters, and joins Jerry at his booth)

LEO
Jerry, hello! (Sits down)

JERRY
So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay?

LEO
I still have the ringing in the ears. Sounds like the phone.

JERRY
(Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?

LEO
What, are you kidding? I should you loaning you money! (Quickly amending what he just said) But I'm not.

JERRY
(Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.

LEO
Why didn't ya say hello?

JERRY
Because you were too busy stealing a book.

LEO
(Giving a courtesy lesson) You still say hello.

JERRY
(Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.

LEO
Oh, they don't care. We all do it.

JERRY
Who, criminals?

LEO
Senior citizens. No big deal.

JERRY
You could get arrested.

LEO
Arrested? Come on! (Goes into a routine explaination for his stealing) I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it. What's my name? Will you take me
home?

JERRY
(Pleading) Leo..

LEO
Alright, alright. Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. You made your point.

JERRY
(Thinking he's stopped Leo's thefts) Thank you.

LEO
(Yelling out to every one in the coffee shop) Will somebody answer that damn phone?!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Peterman office building hallway]

ELAINE
(Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?

WALTER
Well..

ELAINE
"Well"? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.
(Elaine enters into the break room. There, she sees Zach making out with another co-worker)

ELAINE
(Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh..

WALTER
(Pointing at the closed door) Isn't that Zach?

ELAINE
Yeah.

WALTER
Aren't you upset?

ELAINE
(Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
NYC street]
(Kramer and Newman are standing there with a rickshaw. Close by are three homeless guys in a line)

KRAMER
Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated,
hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're
from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.
(One of the 2 remaining homeless men drops a bottle)

HOMELESS MAN
The government!

KRAMER
(Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.
(Kramer looks at the two confused guys) Or a shirt..

NEWMAN
Alright, who's first?
(The homeless man with a shirt raises his hand. Kramer pats him on the shoulder - dust flies into the air)

KRMAER
Hey.

NEWMAN
Name, please.

HOMELESS MAN
Rusty.

NEWMAN
(Writing on a clipboard) Rusty.

KRAMER
(To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.

NEWMAN
(To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what you've got! Ok? Ready, and
go!
(Rusty takes off down the street with the rickshaw)

KRAMER
(Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form.

NEWMAN
(Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're gonna have to do this all day for very little money.
(They both notice that Rusty is not stopping)

KRAMER
Hey, what's he doin'?

NEWMAN
I think he stealing our rickshaw!

KRAMER
Well, then, he's out!
(Newman stops his timer. The other homeless man is still standing in line - alone)

HOMELESS MAN 2
(Salutes Kramer) I'll take the job. Potato salad!"
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Bookstore]
(Jerry and George are at Brentano's. George is trying to return the book)

GEORGE
Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.

CASHIER
(Puts the book's code into the computer) I'm sorry, we can't take this book back.

GEORGE
Why not?

CASHIER
It's been flagged.

GEORGE
(Confused) Flagged?

CASHIER
It's been in the bathroom.

GEORGE
It says that on the computer?

CASHIER
Please take it home. We don't want it near the other books.

GEORGE
(Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!
(George storms out. Jerry is about to follow until he sees Leo stealing another book)

JERRY
(To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with
shoplifting..

GUARD
Mm-hmm. Where's your uncle?

JERRY
(Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..

GAURD
(Into his walkie-talkie) We have a 51-50 in paperbacks. All units respond.

JERRY
'51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?

GUARD
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to stand out of the way and let us handle this. (The Guard rushes tward Uncle Leo) Swarm! Swarm!
(Suddenly, Leo is surrounded by guards)

LEO
What?! I'm an old man! I'm confused!

GUARD
You're under arrest.

JERRY
(To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.

LEO
Jerry, you ratted me out?!

JERRY
(Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello?

LEO
Hello.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry is on the phone with his parents)

JERRY
Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.

HELEN
Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.

JERRY
(Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.

MORTY
She's got priors.

JERRY
(Not believeing it) Prior convictions? Leo?

HELEN
It was a crime of passion. Leave it alone.

MORTY
Besides, it's not stealing if it's something you need.

JERRY
(Confused) What does that mean?

HELEN
Nobody pays for everyting.

JERRY
(Shocked at his parents) You're stealing too?!

MORTY
Nothing. Batteries. (Jerry scoffs) Well, they wear out so quick.

JERRY
Mom, you too?

HELEN
Sometimes your father forgets, so I have to steal them.
(Kramer and Newman both enter)

JERRY
Alright, I'll talk to you later.

KRAMER
(While washing his hands in Jerry's kithen sink) Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes a noise), he bolted.

JERRY
(Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.

KRAMER
(To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.

NEWMAN
We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters. I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.
(Newman and Kramer both go to leave)

JERRY
To the Idiotmobile!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
The Coffee shop]
(Jerry and Elaine are sitting at a booth)

JERRY
So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?

ELAINE
That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-

JERRY
(Butting in) Tina Turner?

ELAINE
(Accepting) Alright.
(George enters with his large art book)

GEORGE
Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!

JERRY
Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?

GEORGE
I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.

JERRY
(Stern on George) Not underpants.

ELAINE
Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.
(Uncle Leo is at the front desk in Monks. He's paying for his check)

JERRY
(Getting up) Uncle Leo. Hello!

LEO
(Bitter) Jerry.

JERRY
(Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.

LEO
(Exiting) You mean my crime of passion? If anyone betrays me, I never forget!

JERRY
(Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
(Elaine has picked up George's book, and is now thumbing through it)

ELAINE
French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George) Now, what is the problem with this book?

GEORGE
Nothing.

ELAINE
How much do you want for it?

GEORGE
You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.
(Jerry has given up on Leo, and now rejoins Elaine and George at the booth)

JERRY
Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?

GEORGE
(Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands, he tries to silence Jerry) Jerry, simmer down.

JERRY
(Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.

ELAINE
(Confused) What is wrong with this book?

GEORGE
Simmer!

JERRY
That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-

ELAINE
(Cutting Jerry off, she stands up, trying to get away from the book. Yelling out) Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs
to the bathroom to wash her hands)

GEORGE
(The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?

JERRY
I don't read in the bathroom.

GEORGE
Well, aren't you something?

Elaine's office]

PETERMAN
Elaine, do you have a moment? It's about your lover.

ELAINE
(Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.

PETERMAN
Elaine, who among us hasn't snuck into the break room to nibble on a love newton?

ELAINE
(Confused) Love newton?

PETERMAN
I'm afraid the problem with Zach is more serious. He's back on the horse, Elaine. Smack. White palace. The Chinaman's nightcap.

ELAINE
An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better!

PETERMAN
And, in a tiny way, I almost feel responsible. I'm the one who sent him to Thailand - in search of low-cost whistles. Filled his head with pseudoerotic
tales of my own Opium excursions. Plus, I have him some phone numbers of places he could score near the hotel.

ELAINE
Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!

PETERMAN
Damn it, Elaine. That wasn't Zach. That was the yam-yam. Now, he is going cold turkey. (Ordering) And you will be at his side.

ELAINE
Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-

PETERMAN
(Cutting her off) No buts, Elaine. Or I will strip you of your 'associate' status. (Goes to leave) Uh, P.S., the first twenty-four hours are the worst.
Better bring a poncho.

(Now, Jerry has slipped into a dream. He visualizes Leo in prison *NOTE* The following scene of Leo in jail is a parody of the movie "Cape Fear")

LEO
(Leo has "Jerry" written on the fingers his right hand, and "Hello" written on his left. He's doing pull-ups) Jerry. Hello. Jerry. Hello. Jerry. (Turns to the right,
yelling out) Answer that damn phone!

ELAINE
Eat your soup!

JERRY
You're not feeding him, are you?

ELAINE
Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you, away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the
bucket) There you go, that's it. (To Jerry) You know what? I gotta go.
(Jerry hangs up, then tries to go back to sleep. Kramer walks in)

KRAMER
Hey, buddy.

JERRY

JERRY
Get out of here!

(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home.

NEWMAN
Uh..

KRAMER
What?

NEWMAN
You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after all, it is a conveyance.

KRAMER
Yes, that's true.

NEWMAN
So, which one of us is gonna pull?

KRAMER
Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot,
zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..

NEWMAN
(Realizing he won) Yeah.

GEORGE
Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.

REBECCA
What's the value of the book?

GEORGE
Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney.

REBECCA
(Correcting. Stern) It's DeMornay. Rebecca DeMornay.

GEORGE
Oh.

REBECCA
(Opens the cover of the book) Oh, wait a second. (Certain) This book has been in the bathroom.

GEORGE
(Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.

REBECCA
It's been flagged. I know. I used to work in a Brentano's. Mister, we're trying to help the homeless heare - it's bad enough that we have some nut out
there trying to strap 'em to a rickshaw!

GEORGE
(Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?

REBECCA
Yeah, and here it is: You get your toilet book out of here, and I won't jump over this counter and punch you in the brain!

Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.

NEWMAN
Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.

KRAMER
(Stretching) Oh..
(The rickshaw starts to roll back down the hill)

NEWMAN
(Scared) Boy.. Boy. Kramer!

Woah! Wait!

(Sarcasticly joking) It certainly has.

GEORGE
So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.

(Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?

GEORGE
I'm goin' in!
(George walks off to steal one of the books. The manager walks up to Jerry)

MANAGER
Did you want to speak with the manager?

JERRY
Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..

MANAGER
Yes, Uncle Leo. I remember him. I'm sorry, our policy is we prosecute all shoplifters.

JERRY
(Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.

MANAGER
That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone.

JERRY
So it could be anyone?

MANAGER
I.. guess. As long as we catch him in the act.

Elaine takes a piece of cake and makes her way to the door, but is stopped as a male worker carrying a cake enters.

MALE WORKER
Elaine! Where're you going? It's Walter's last day. We have to celebrate.

ELAINE
It's his birthday and it's his last day?

MALE WORKER

INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY
Jerry and Elaine stand in front of his stereo.

JERRY
What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?

ELAINE
It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?

JERRY
Why aren't you there now?

ELAINE
I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
They sit on the sofa.

JERRY
You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.

ELAINE
Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..

JERRY
Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?

ELAINE
Your old high school hangout? Why?

JERRY
They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
Kramer barges through the door holding a roll of yellow police tape.

KRAMER
Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.
Jerry walks towards the counter where Kramer has placed some of the tape.

KRAMER
Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.

JERRY
Where did you get this?

KRAMER
Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.

JERRY
You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?

KRAMER
They want to know why they never see you.
Kramer ties a piece of tape around a banana.

KRAMER
I'm gonna eat that later.

JERRY
So they just gave you this?

KRAMER
Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.

ELAINE
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?

KRAMER
Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.

JERRY
How come I haven't read about this?

KRAMER
Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.

ELAINE
Really? What're the other titles?

KRAMER
Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad.

JERRY
Son of dad?

KRAMER
Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.

George and Jerry walk across the room.

They walk over to watch a boy playing Frogger.

JERRY
Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.

GEORGE
Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!
The boy loses.

BOY
Thanks a lot.

Ah, beat it, punk.
The boy exits.

JERRY
Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?

Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.

JERRY
I remember that night.

Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.

GEORGE
So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?

JERRY
Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?

GEORGE
What?

JERRY
Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.

KRAMER
You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.
JERRYL Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.

KRAMER
Not as many as there used to be.

GEORGE
No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?
Kramer peels and eats an orange.

KRAMER
You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.

JERRY
Another friend?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.

GEORGE
Well, is he good, Kramer?
George gets up and walks towards Kramer.

KRAMER
Oh, he's the best...and the worst.

GEORGE
Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.

KRAMER
Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.

GEORGE
Slippery Pete?

KRAMER
Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.

GEORGE
All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!

People can be heard singing "Happy Birthday" in the background of Elaine's office.

JERRY
What is that?

ELAINE
Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 4:00 sugar rush.

JERRY
So join in.

ELAINE
I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.

ELAINE
Ooh, it's a cake walk.
She takes a bite of the cake. Outside in the hallway, Mr. Peterman can be heard singing.

PETERMAN (SINGING)
Get well, get well soon we wish you to get well.
Elaine quickly puts the box back in the fridge. Mr. Peterman enters his office.

PETERMAN
Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman, um--

PETERMAN
We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?

ELAINE
No, sir, I can't.

Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--

GEORGE
Finished your thought.
George gets up and walks over to the sink. Elaine enters.

ELAINE
Guess what I ate.

GEORGE
An ostrich burger.

ELAINE
No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.

JERRY
How'd it taste?

ELAINE
A little stale.

JERRY
Yeah.

GEORGE (NUDGES ELAINE WITH HIS ELBOW)
So, uh are you sleeping with Peterman?

ELAINE (NUDGES GEORGE WITH HER ELBOW)
No. He doesn't know I ate it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even it out.

You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
Jerry and Elaine start to walk from the counter towards the table.

ELAINE
Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.

KRAMER
Ahh! I'm out! No tape left!

JERRY
Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.

GEORGE
Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this.

JERRY
By yourself?

GEORGE
Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.
George pushes the machine onto the street. From a view in the sky, we see him dodging cars, hopping back and forth into lanes of traffic. Frogger music and sound effects play.

SHLOMO
He looks like a Frog.

SLIPPERY PETE
So do you.
George makes it across just as a huge truck comes barreling down the street. George tries to get the Frogger onto the sidewalk, but can't. He futilely sticks his hand out trying to stop the truck which honks. George jumps out of the truck's way and onto the sidewalk as the Frogger is smashed.

But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?

There's no G-bone.

Thank you. Nice job.

MAID
Is this mine?

JERRY
Yeah.
The maid leaves Jerry's apartment. Elaine smiles at Jerry.

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?

JERRY
Notice what? She's not really even a maid.

ELAINE
Oh.

JERRY
She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.

ELAINE
Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.
Kramer enters.

KRAMER
Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.

JERRY
You have a girlfriend?
Jerry stands up; Kramer opens the fridge.

KRAMER
Jerry, where have you been?

JERRY
At a rodeo. Where's she moving?

KRAMER
Downtown.

ELAINE
Downtown New York?

KRAMER
Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.

JERRY
It's like 10 minutes by subway.

KRAMER
I don't know.
Kramer opens a bottled carbonated drink which overflows and spills onto the floor.

KRAMER
Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.

ELAINE
What? What is that?

JERRY
That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.

ELAINE
I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.

KRAMER
Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.

ELAINE
At work?

KRAMER
No. At your apartment.

ELAINE
I don't have a fax machine.

JERRY
Here we go.

KRAMER
Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.

JERRY
And a dead bolt.
KRAMER (to Elaine) Are ya sure you don't have one? Because there's a lot of stuff in my apartment I've never seen.

ELAINE
Then maybe you have a fax machine.

KRAMER
You just blew my mind.

CINDY
Hi, Elaine.
Jerry groans as Elaine enters and Cindy exits.

ELAINE
All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.

JERRY
Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?

ELAINE
You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.

JERRY
No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--

ELAINE
What? A health plan?

JERRY
I was going to say, "Being a good host."

ELAINE
Oh-ho-ho. Oh.

JERRY
But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.

ELAINE
So you consider this a relationship?

JERRY
Yes, I do.

ELAINE
Oh. Have you been out?

JERRY
Yes, we have.

ELAINE

She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
Kramer enters.

Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.
Kramer sits down on the couch.

ELAINE
Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?

KRAMER
Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.

ELAINE
Which ones?

KRAMER
Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.

ELAINE
So this is never gonna stop?

KRAMER
Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?

Why are we slowing down?
Music plays in the background.

JERRY
What is that music?

GEORGE
What's with all these flags?

JERRY
Oh, no.

ELAINE AND JERRY
It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!

ELAINE
Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through.
We're never getting home.
Kramer stands up on the back seat.

KRAMER
All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.

STOCK FOOTAGE
Puerto Rican Day parade.
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
Kramer runs along the sidewalk and hops into the back seat of a black Saab.

KRAMER
Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.
There is a Puerto Rican family in the car.

PUERTO RICAN MAN
Well, it is our day.

KRAMER
Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.
Kramer hops out.
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY
Still sitting stopped in traffic are Elaine, Jerry, and George. They are listening to the radio.

RADIO
And the Mets score two in the eighth inning.

JERRY
See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.

GEORGE
I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.

ELAINE
I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.

JERRY
I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.

KRAMER
All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.

JERRY
But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?

GEORGE
Just inch over. You worm your way.

ELAINE
Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.

KRAMER
You know, you should make yourself throw up.

ELAINE
Huh?

KRAMER
You know you're going to.

JERRY
All right, I'm worming.

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.

JERRY
They're not letting me in.

GEORGE
My hand is out.

JERRY
Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.

ELAINE
You sure you want his face?

KRAMER
No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso.

GEORGE
This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.

JERRY
The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.

GEORGE
Look at me! I am man! I am you!
The man in the other car looks over at George. Elaine, sitting behind George, aids in the cause by pleading to the man by mouthing the words, "Hi, can we go in?"

GEORGE
All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.

KRAMER
Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.

JERRY
One more lane to go.

GEORGE
All right! We're here!
Just as Jerry is about to enter the one-way street, Lamar and his maroon Golf cut him off.

LAMAR
Oh, look who's here. My old buddy, black Saab.

JERRY
Maroon Golf.

LAMAR
Where you goin', black Saab? You seem to be a tad askew.

JERRY
Could you move your car back a little?

LAMAR
Oh. Sorry. I seem to have cut you off.

ELAINE
All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.
Elaine pushes George's seat forward slamming his head onto the dashboard. She gets out.

JERRY
You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.

ELAINE
I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.

KRAMER
Con dios? Well, that's rude.

JERRY
Can you believe her?

GEORGE
Yeah. I'll see you later.

JERRY
Where are you going?

GEORGE
The movies. Blimp is playing right there.

JERRY
You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?

GEORGE
It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.

JERRY
That's not what I do.

GEORGE
Isn't it?

JERRY
Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
George leaves.

KRAMER
You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.

STOCK FOOTAGE
Taxis stuck in traffic.
INT. TAXI CAB - DAY
Elaine sits in the back.

ELAINE
Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
She moves so she can yell out the driver's open window.

ELAINE (YELLING)
Hey! Fold your dog's ear back!
She leans back.

ELAINE
Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.

CAB DRIVER
No, you can't.

ELAINE
Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here.
She pays her fare and gets out.

The cab stops and she gets back in.

GEORGE
Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.

Oh, I think someone has one of those funny laser pointers.
A red laser moves around the movie screen. Everyone laughs as the dot rests on the breasts of the movie actress.
INT. MOVIE LOBBY - DAY
The laser pointer guy uses his laser to point at a box of Skittles and RC Cola.

LASER GUY
Gimme a box of those and one of those.

GEORGE
Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?

LASER GUY
The laser's not funny. I'm funny.

GEORGE
Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.

LASER GUY
Uh-huh.

GEORGE
It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY
Kramer and Jerry sit listening to the radio.
RADIO What a comeback for the New York Mets-- 6 runs in the bottom of the ninth.

JERRY
I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.

LAMAR
This traffic's a killer, ain't it?

KRAMER
You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.

JERRY
Walk away?

KRAMER
You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.

JERRY
Isn't there a deductible?

KRAMER
All right, what is your deductible?

JERRY
I don't know.

KRAMER
Yes, because they've already deducted it.

JERRY
From what?

KRAMER
The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.

JERRY
We're not leaving the car!

KRAMER
All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.

JERRY
Absolutely not. He sped up.

RADIO
Swung on, line hard toward left center field. That's in the gap, that's a base hit.

JERRY
I'm ready to talk.
INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
George and the ladies are sitting in their seats.

LADY 1
Hey! There's that laser guy again.

LADY 2
He's funny. I never meet anyone funny.

LADY 1
I know. A sense of humor is so much more important to me than looks or hair.

LADY 2
Mmm, yeah.
There's an explosion on the screen. The laser moves around the screen and everyone laughs.

GEORGE
That's gotta hurt!
Everyone stops laughing.

GEORGE
It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!
George stands up.

GEORGE
Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!
The laser guy points the laser at George's head.

LADY 1
Look! It's on the bald guy.

LADY 2
I am so glad we came to this showing.
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
Kramer is talking to Lamar while Jerry waits in his car. Kramer walks to Jerry.

KRAMER
Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an "I am sorry" wave.

JERRY
What's that?

KRAMER
You raise the hand, lower the head-- "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!" You get my drift.

JERRY
Ok!
Jerry puts both hands up over his head and does the "I'm Sorry" wave.

LAMAR
Hallelujah. Praise the lord. But I'll take it.

KRAMER
Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.
Kramer gets in the car. George shows up and climbs into the back seat.

GEORGE
All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.

JERRY
What's that on your forehead?

GEORGE
It's probably chocolate.

JERRY
Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!

GEORGE
All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!

JERRY
See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.

LAMAR
What was that?

JERRY
I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!
As Jerry pulls into the one way street, a taxi comes down the street and blocks him in. In the taxi is Elaine.

JERRY
Elaine?!

PUERTO RICAN MAN
Buenos dias, my friend.

JERRY
Not you! The guy in the Amigo.
INT. TAXI CAB - DAY
Elaine sits frustrated in the cab.

ELAINE
Uh, well, uh, here--here is good.

TAXI DRIVER
Oh, yeah, sure, and now I'm gonna be stuck here. But you knew the way to go! You went to college!

ELAINE
Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.
She pays the driver and gets out.
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
Elaine walks up to Jerry.

ELAINE
Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?

JERRY
Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!

LAMAR
So that was your girlfriend that blocked you in. That's real good.

ELAINE
I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.

JERRY
Elaine, he doesn't need-

LAMAR
Used to date? So I guess you found out he's a jackass.

JERRY
'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
Kramer and George walk along eating churros.

KRAMER
Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?

GEORGE
Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.

ELAINE
All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
Elaine leaves.

GEORGE
This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?

JERRY
I don't know.

GEORGE
I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.

KRAMER
You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.
Kramer leaves.

JERRY
Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.

GEORGE
Oh, my god.

JERRY
Hey, there's the soda guy.

LAMAR
Hey, jackass! Get me a diet Dr. Pepper!

JERRY (EXASPERATED)
All right!
George stands petrified.
EXT. BARRICADE - DAY
A police barricade set up on the parade route prevents a crowd of people from crossing. Elaine pushes her way through the crowd.

OLDER MAN
Hey, hey, hey!

OLDER WOMAN
Wha--ow!

ELAINE
Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!

OLDER MAN
Well, none of us can! We're trapped!

OLDER WOMAN
Ow!

ELAINE
Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.
Elaine picks up a nylon flap that covers the sides of some bleachers.

OLDER MAN
Oh, I don't know if that's such a good idea.

ELAINE
Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!

OLDER WOMAN
Father?

PRIEST
None of us saw the nylon flap. That might mean something.

PREGNANT WOMAN
Oh, all right, all right!
People start going under the bleachers.

ELAINE
All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

BUSINESS MAN
But it's dark!

ELAINE
Get in there!
EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - DAY
Kramer looks for a bathroom. He sees a sign that reads, "Rest rooms are for patrons only." There's another sign that reads apartment for sale.
INT. APARTMENT - DAY
There's a knock at the door and the sales woman answers it. It's Kramer.

KRAMER
Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment.

SALES WOMAN
Yes! Come in, come in.

KRAMER
Ok.

SALES WOMAN

KRAMER
Oh. Delicious to meet you.

Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?

SALES WOMAN
The asking price is $1.5 million.

KRAMER
Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?

KRAMER
How about a bathroom?

SALES WOMAN

Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?

SALES WOMAN
Just down the hall.

He saunters to the bathroom.

Well, I, for one, really respect that.

PREGNANT WOMAN
Oh, thank you.

PRIEST

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
Jerry stands next to his car with a drink.

LAMAR
You know, I don't think I've ever seen a man driving a Saab convertible. Still haven't.

JERRY (SARCASTICALLY)
Ho ho!
George returns wearing mirrored sunglasses.

JERRY
What seems to be the problem, officer?

GEORGE
They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?

JERRY
At me?

GEORGE
No.

JERRY
Oh. It's back.

GEORGE
Bring it on, baby

JERRY
What if it gets in the side?

GEORGE
The side?

JERRY
Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
George rips off his glasses.

GEORGE
All right!

JERRY
Oh. It's in your eye now.
George runs off screaming. Kramer runs up to Jerry with a Puerto Rican flag draped around him.

KRAMER
Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!

JERRY
Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!

JERRY
Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!

SALES WOMAN
Would you like to see the rest of the apartment, Mister, um--

JERRY
Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?

SALES WOMAN
Well, it's--

JERRY
Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?

SALES WOMAN
Mr. Varnsen, if you like the apartment, I should tell you I've also had some interest from a wealthy industrialist.

JERRY
Not Pennypacker!

SALES WOMAN
You know him?

JERRY
I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
INT. JERRY'S CAR - DAY
George and Kramer sit in the car. George looks in the rear view mirror.

GEORGE
Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.
George exits the car.
INT. BLEACHERS - DAY
Elaine and the group reach the end of the bleachers.

ELAINE
We should be able to get across right through here!
She lifts the nylon flap to find a brick wall.

OLDER WOMAN
It's a dead end!

ELAINE
Oh, no! I thought--

BUSINESS MAN
You thought?! We're gonna die in the dark! I knew it! I knew it! We're gonna die!

ELAINE
Get a hold of yourself!

Oh, come on!
OLDER WOMAN Oooh!

ELAINE
Sorry. Somebody...help us!
EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY
Lots of people sit on the bleachers. A cop stands guard.

They lift the floorboards to reveal Elaine and her group.

ELAINE

Don't judge me!

ELAINE
Help us up so we can cross the street?

INT. BLEACHERS - DAY

BUSINESS MAN
Wanna make out some more?

ELAINE
Oh, god! Let us out!
EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - DAY
George hides behind a van and sees a man with a pen. He sneaks up and grabs the pen and destroys it. He ends up with ink all over his hands.

GEORGE
That wasn't a laser pen.

DELIVERY MAN
No. It's just a pen.
The delivery man laughs.

GEORGE
Oh, that's funny

DELIVERY MAN
No. You have, like, a dot on your face. Whoever's doing that is very clever.
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
Kramer lights a cigar with a sparkler.

KRAMER
Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.
He tosses the sparkler into the back seat of Jerry's car where it lands on the Puerto Rican flag.

KRAMER
Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
Lamar starts to laugh as he sees the smoke rise.

KRAMER
See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?
Kramer smells the smoke, turns, and sees the fire.

KRAMER
Ooh!!Dios mio!
He grabs the flag, throws it onto the sidewalk and stops on it.

MAN
Hey! There's a guy burning the Puerto Rican flag!

BOB
Who! Who is burning the flag?!

KRAMER
Oh, no.

BOB
Him?!

CEDRIC
That's not very nice.

KRAMER
It was an accident.

BOB
Do you know what day this is? Because I know what day this is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what day this is!

CEDRIC
Because it's Puerto Rican day.

BOB
Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! What do you think of that?

KRAMER
Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!
Kramer runs off screaming. The others give chase.
INT. APARTMENT - DAY
The sales woman lets George in.

SALES WOMAN
Right this way, Mr. Vandelay.

GEORGE
Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?

SALES WOMAN
It's down the hall.
George walks to the bathroom, but stops when he sees Jerry.

JERRY
Oh, hello...

GEORGE
Art.

JERRY
Mr. Vandelay, of course.

SALES WOMAN
You two know each other?
Kramer bursts through the door.

SALES WOMAN
Mr. Pennypacker!

KRAMER
Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.

SALES WOMAN
Mr. Pennypacker, this is Mr. Vandelay, And you know Mr. Varnsen

KRAMER
Vandelay.

GEORGE
Pennypacker. Varnsen.

JERRY
Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?

KRAMER
The factory?

JERRY
The Saab factory?

KRAMER
Jerry, that's in Sweden.
George turns on the TV as Jerry runs to the window just in time to see a mob attacking his car.

JERRY
My car!

KRAMER
Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.

GEORGE
Jerry, the Mets lost.

JERRY
I love a parade!
EXT. CITY SIDEWALK - NIGHT
Jerry's car is stuck in a stairwell outside a building. Kramer, George, and Jerry admire the mob's handiwork.

GEORGE
How do you suppose they did that?

KRAMER
Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?

JERRY
Well, what about my car?

KRAMER
Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.
Elaine approaches the group. She is totally disheveled with popcorn in her hair and her clothing stained.

JERRY
Hey, there's Elaine.

ELAINE
Hey.

JERRY
Well, you look, uh...relaxed.

ELAINE
Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.
Lamar drives up in his maroon Golf.

LAMAR
Hey, black Saab. Looks like that building cut you off! Ha ha ha! See ya around!
He drives off.

JERRY
Well, at least he didn't-

LAMAR
Jackass!
Jerry sets his car alarm.

JERRY
Somebody remember where we parked.

KRAMER
This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.
The foursome walk off as a laser lights up George's rear end.
End.

GEORGE
Well... it's a magnificent stone.

MR. ROSS
They put it up this morning.
[pause.]

GEORGE
It's just a magnificent stone. (turns to Jerry) Jerry?
[Jerry, obviously uncomfortable, turns slowly and shrugs his shoulders at George.]

MRS. ROSS
George... we'll leave you alone with her.

GEORGE
What?

MRS. ROSS
I'm sure there are things you'd like to say.
[She pats his shoulder, and then she and her husband leave Jerry and George alone with Susan.]

GEORGE
No, I-I-I-I'm good. Really.
[Jerry turns around to follow the Rosses.]

GEORGE
Jerry...
[He tries to keep Jerry there, but Jerry jerks away. George then turns to Susan's stone nervously, trying to think of where to begin. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ross offers Jerry an alcoholic beverage of some sort.]

JERRY
Thank you, no.
[She continues drinking.]

GEORGE
(to Susan's stone)...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah.
[New scene.
Jerry's apartment.]

GEORGE
Boy, that was awkward!

JERRY
I don't mind the cemetery.

GEORGE
What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?

JERRY
Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.

GEORGE
What is that?

JERRY
Star Trek II.

GEORGE
(identifying it) Wrath of Khan!

JERRY
Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.

GEORGE
That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...

JERRY
Yeah...
[For a brief moment, the two become overwhelmed with emotion.]

GEORGE
Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.

JERRY
So it's over?

GEORGE
I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.

JERRY
All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?

GEORGE
Yes! Nothing says George like a movie!
[Kramer enters as George is leaving.]

KRAMER
Movie?

JERRY
Yeah, you in?

KRAMER
No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.

GEORGE
George is going to the movies! (exits)

JERRY
(to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?

KRAMER
(pronouncing it "kar-ah-tay") Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.

JERRY
..But with punching and kicking.

KRAMER
Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle with his hands).

JERRY
Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.

KRAMER
What, she's been away?

JERRY
She's been in Mexico for six weeks.

KRAMER
No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.

JERRY
That was July 4th!
[Kramer pauses to think.]

JERRY
Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands).
[New scene.
The coffee shop.]

ELAINE
It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.

JERRY
Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?

ELAINE
Oh, tons!

JERRY
Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?

ELAINE
(laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?

JERRY
No, I don't.

ELAINE
So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?

JERRY
My what?

ELAINE
Jeannie... your fiancee.

JERRY
Oh, yeah, that. Well...

ELAINE
All right. Spill it, Jerome.

JERRY
There's really not that much to tell.
[flashback sequence of Jerry and Jeannie at the coffee shop begins as Jerry narrates.]
"About a month ago, we were here having lunch, when all of a sudden we both just blurted out..."

JERRY & JEANNIE
(simultaneously) I hate you!
[They both chuckle over the coincidence.]

JEANNIE
See ya.

JERRY
See ya.
[Jeannie returns her ring to Jerry, who puts it in his pocket.]
"It was unprecendented. I mean, it was the first truly mutual breakup in relationship history."
[flashback ends.]

JERRY
(continuing) No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.

ELAINE
You've never felt remorse.

JERRY
I know, I feel bad about that...

ELAINE
I bet your parents were upset, huh?

JERRY
Eh.

ELAINE
You haven't told them yet, have you?

JERRY
No.
[New scene.
J. Peterman's office.]

DUGAN
"So I pressed through the rushes, there below me, the shimmering waters of Lake Victoria..."

J. PETERMAN
Oh, for the love of God, man! Just tell me what the product is.

DUGAN
It's a, uh, washcloth.

J. PETERMAN
No washcloths!

ELAINE
Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.

J. PETERMAN
(rubbing his neck) Oh, my neck is one gargantuan monkey fist.

ELAINE
Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?

J. PETERMAN
Yes, yes. Go on, go on, go on.

ELAINE
Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.
[Peterman walks out, groaning.]

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman?
[New scene.
The street.]

GEORGE
(inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.

JERRY
Pride?

GEORGE
No. Autonomy, complete and total autonomy.

JERRY
Well, you're your own boss now.

GEORGE
I wanna go to a tractor pull.

JERRY
Go ahead.

GEORGE
I am staying out all night!

JERRY
Who's stopping you?

GEORGE
I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.

JERRY
Whatever.
[Jerry sees someone he knows.]

JERRY
Oh God.

GEORGE
What?

JERRY
It's Dolores.

GEORGE
Who?

JERRY
Mulva.
[Dolores notices Jerry.]

DOLORES
Jerry, hi.

JERRY
Hi, Dolores. George, you remember Dolores?

GEORGE
Dolores!

DOLORES
Hi. (to Jerry) I heard you got engaged.

JERRY
Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.

DOLORES
Oh, that's too bad. You know... we should get together sometime. See ya.

JERRY
See ya.

GEORGE
Bye, Dolores.
[Dolores walks away.]

GEORGE
I thought Mulva hated you.

JERRY
Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.

GEORGE
All the way?

JERRY
Not our "all the way", their "all the way." I got the stink of responsibility on me.

GEORGE
Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.

JERRY
You stink worse than I do!

GEORGE
I'm feeling something else here, Jerry!
[New scene.
J. Peterman's office.]

SECRETARY
Elaine, it's Mr. Peterman on the phone.

ELAINE
(answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?

J. PETERMAN
Elaine, I'll be blunt. I'm burnt out. I'm fried. My mind is as barren as the surface of the moon. I can run that catalog no longer.

ELAINE
What? Well, who's gonna do it?

J. PETERMAN
What about you?

ELAINE
Me? Why me?

J. PETERMAN
Why, indeed.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.

J. PETERMAN
I've already left, Elaine. I'm in Burma.

ELAINE
Burma?

J. PETERMAN
You most likely know it as Myanmar, but it will always be Burma to me. Bonne chance, Elaine. (to a passerby) You there on the motorbike! Sell me one of your melons! (runs after him)
[The phone is not hung up.]

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman?
[New scene.
Jerry's apartment.]

JERRY
Where?

ELAINE
Burma.

JERRY
Isn't it Myanmar now?

ELAINE
Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!

JERRY
No, certainly not.

ELAINE
I mean, I can't give people orders!

JERRY
No one's gonna listen to you.

ELAINE
I am not qualified to run the catalog!

JERRY
You're not qualified to work at the catalog.
[Elaine groans in frustration as Kramer enters.]

KRAMER
Hey. (notices Elaine) What's wrong?

ELAINE
Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.

KRAMER
Where?

JERRY
Myanmar.

KRAMER
The discount pharmacy?

ELAINE
Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.

KRAMER
Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...

ELAINE
Karate?

KRAMER
Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.

ELAINE
Katra?

KRAMER
Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, "Yes, I can!"

JERRY
Sammy Davis had it.

KRAMER
So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.

ELAINE
Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.

KRAMER
Sure you have.

ELAINE
I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.

KRAMER
You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here.

ELAINE
(excitedly) Okay.
[Kramer slams the door behind her.]

KRAMER
That kid is gonna be all right.

JERRY
No, she's not.
[There's a knock at Jerry's door.]

JOEY
Come on, Kramer!

KRAMER
Hey there.

JOEY
Come on. Mom's down in the car.

KRAMER
Okay, Joey.
[Joey exits.]

JERRY
You guys both have class at the same time?

KRAMER
No, we're in the same class.

JERRY
What do you mean you're in the same class?

KRAMER
He almost beat me.

JERRY
Kramer, you're fighting children?!

KRAMER
We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.

JERRY
He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!
[Car horn honks.]

KRAMER
I got carpool. (exits)
[New scene.
Kramer's carpool.]

KRAMER
Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.

JOEY
Hey, could we stop for ice cream on the way home, mom?

MRS. ZANFINO
Mmm, I don't know...
[The kids begin pleading, so Kramer joins in.]

MRS. ZANFINO
All right.

KIDS & KRAMER
Yay!
[New scene.
J. Peterman's office. Elaine has called in all her new employees.]

DUGAN
*You're* taking the job?

ELAINE
You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 6:00. No, make that six ideas by 4:00. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!
[As everyone rushes out, Elaine laughs, amazed at the new power she now holds.]
[New scene.
Kramer's karate class.]

SENSEI
Are you prepared for kumite?

KRAMER & JOEY
Yes, sensei.

SENSEI
Fight stance.
[Kramer & Joey assume fight stance.]

SENSEI
Hydjama! Begin!
[Kramer then frantically makes several karate hand motions, intimidating Joey. What follows is a montage of sequences featuring Kramer challenging his class. He grabs an opponent by the foot and flips him over; knocks one out with a simple karate chop to the head; has another turned upside down being shaken violently; drags another along the floor; and chases several at once.]

SENSEI
(raising Kramer's arm) Winner!
[The other kids bow their heads in disgrace.]
[New scene.
George's apartment, in a very cluttered state. George is walking around in nothing but boxers, humming to himself while carrying a soda and a block of cheese. There's a knock at his door.]

GEORGE
It's open!
[As George plops onto the sofa, the Rosses enter.]

GEORGE
(surprised) Rosses.

MRS. ROSS
Hello, George.

GEORGE
Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs)

MR. ROSS
We, uh, tried to call, but the line was busy.

GEORGE
Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)

MRS. ROSS
We know the last three months have been hard on you.

GEORGE
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.

MR. ROSS
And they've been hard on us, too. It's a terrible tragedy when parents outlive their children.

GEORGE
Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.

MR. ROSS
That's why we decided to create a foundation to preserve Susan's memory.

GEORGE
Oh, that's wonderful.
Mr. Ross. And, of course, we want you to be an integral part.

GEORGE
Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral?

MR. ROSS
You'll be on the board of directors.

GEORGE
(feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...

MRS. ROSS
Don't worry, George. The foundation will revolve around your schedule. Evenings, weekends, whenever you have free time.

GEORGE
I can't believe this is happening.

MR. ROSS
Well, it wouldn't have without your friend Jerry's inspirational words. He said to us, "She's not really dead if her shadow is..." Uh, w-what was it, dear?

MRS. ROSS
Something about a way, a-and a light, uh... ha. Who the hell knows?

MR. ROSS
Well, what's important is that your relationship with Susan doesn't have to end.

MRS. ROSS
So will you be sure to thank Jerry for us?

GEORGE
(feigning happiness) The second I see him.
[New scene.
The coffee shop. Jerry is having lunch when George walks in.]

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
Hey. How's your day, good?

JERRY
Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.

GEORGE
So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh?

JERRY
Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?

GEORGE
What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?

JERRY
No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."

GEORGE
That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it)...that destroyed my life.

JERRY
(stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?

GEORGE
The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.

JERRY
Hey, board of directors. Look at you!

GEORGE
Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!

JERRY
Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.

GEORGE
Don't you see? I'm back in.

JERRY
All because of Wrath of Khan?

GEORGE
Yes!

JERRY
Well, it was the best of those movies.
[The camera is over George's head and spins around repeatedly as George screams.]

GEORGE
KHAN!
[New scene.
The foundation. George is staring intently at a painting of Susan as Wyck walks in.]

WYCK
George.
[George doesn't respond.]

WYCK
George. (taps him on the shoulder)

GEORGE
(startled) Oh!

WYCK
I'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of the Susan Ross Foundation.

GEORGE
Wink.

WYCK
(correcting him) Wyck.

GEORGE
Wyck.

WYCK
Now, as you know, the Rosses had considerable monies.

GEORGE
Oh. I know they have some monies.

WYCK
They had more than some monies. Many, many monies. And they planned to give a sizable portion of their estate to you and Susan after the wedding.

GEORGE
So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--

WYCK
Yes.

GEORGE
And now?

WYCK
Not. It's all been endowed to the foundation, even this townhouse.

GEORGE
This townhouse?

WYCK
This would have been your wedding gift.

GEORGE
And now?

WYCK
Not.

GEORGE
Not.

WYCK
Also endowed. George... I know how much Susan meant to you. It can't be easy.

GEORGE
You know, it really can't.
[New scene.
The coffee shop.]

MULVA
So who broke it off?

JERRY
Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.

MULVA
Oh, come on. Everybody knows there's no such thing as a mutual breakup. Tell me the truth.

JERRY
I am. It was the world's first.

MULVA
You know, when I heard you got engaged, I thought *maybe* you had matured. But obviously there's no growth here. (exits)

JERRY
Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!
[New scene.
Jerry's apartment. The phone is ringing as he's getting in.]

JERRY
(answering) Hello?

SECRETARY
Please hold for Elaine Benes.

JERRY
Oh, I don't believe this.

ELAINE
(picking up) Jerry!

JERRY
Hey!

ELAINE
Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.

JERRY
How's it look?

ELAINE
(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.

JERRY
Huh?

ELAINE
I say, it's a peach.

JERRY
Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?

ELAINE
No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.

JERRY
I gotta do some research here.

ELAINE
Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.

JERRY
Oh, I'm the doofus?

ELAINE
Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus.

JERRY
You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.

ELAINE
Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.

JERRY
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[New scene.
Kramer's karate class. Kramer is beating his opponent, a little girl. Elaine walks in, surprised.]

ELAINE
Kramer!

KRAMER
Oh, hey.

ELAINE
What are you doing?

KRAMER
Oh, well, I-I-I'm dominating.

ELAINE
You never said you were fighting children.

KRAMER
Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.

ELAINE
This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?

KRAMER
No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.

ELAINE
Search... for Spock?!

KRAMER
Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...

ELAINE
(pushes him) You doofus!
[As Kramer is knocked down, there is amazed murmuring among his peers.]
[New scene.
The coffee shop. Jerry is conducting some research.]

JERRY
Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.

WAITRESS #1
More.

WAITRESS #2
Less.

RUTHIE
Same.

WILLIE
Are we about through here?
[Jerry crosses off something on his clipboard.]
[New scene.
A dark, foggy street. Kramer is walking with Joey.]

KRAMER
I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.

JOEY
She had a little change of plans.
[Children emerge from various places in the alley, to ambush Kramer.]

KRAMER
What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?

GIRL
Now we finish it.
[Kramer tries to escape up the fire escape ladder, but the kids drag him down.]

KRAMER
Aah! Aah! Mama!
[New scene.
Jerry's apartment.]

JERRY
(on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.
[Elaine enters.]

JERRY
Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)
[The phone rings again expectedly. Jerry hangs up without answering.]

JERRY
So... did you stop by the dojo?

ELAINE
Yep.

JERRY
How's your confidence level?

ELAINE
Shot.

JERRY
Self-esteem?

ELAINE
Gone.

JERRY
Doofus?

ELAINE
(raises her hand) Yo.

JERRY
All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?
[Elaine takes out the Urban Sombrero and puts it on.]

JERRY
What is that?

ELAINE
It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.

JERRY
Well, nobody sees the... cover.
[Kramer enters.]

KRAMER
God!

JERRY
What happened to you?

KRAMER
Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that?

JERRY
It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.

KRAMER
Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!

ELAINE
(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!

KRAMER
Well, then I was way off!

ELAINE
Well, I'll see ya... (exits)

JERRY
Vaya con dios.

KRAMER
(with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?

JERRY
No, he's still stuck at the foundation.

KRAMER
You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.

JERRY
Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research)
[New scene.
The foundation.]

WYCK
Okay, let's see. The beachhouse. 48 acres... ooh. Southampton. That should fetch a fair price.

GEORGE
Would I have had access to that?

WYCK
Of course, it would have been yours.

GEORGE
And now?
[Wyck turns to face him.]

GEORGE
(anticipating the answer) Not.
[phone rings. George eagerly answers it.]

GEORGE
Hello?

JERRY
Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.

GEORGE
My story?

JERRY
Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?

GEORGE
Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?

WYCK
(chuckling) Oh, no, not even close.

GEORGE
(remorsefully) I can't go.

JERRY
What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!
[George hangs up.]

WYCK
Okay, next item. Susan's doll collection. Estimated value: $2.6 million. What do you say we go through this doll by doll?
[George turns to the portrait of Susan in amazement.]
End.
Opening scene - George at a meeting at the Susan Ross Foundation.

GEORGE
You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!

WYCK
    Well, we think it would be a nice touch for the Foundation literature. Do you have a favorite poet, George?

GEORGE
I like, uh...<mutters something unintelligible under his breath.>

WYCK
Pardon?

GEORGE
<mutters it again>

WYCK
Well, you should choose the poem since you knew Susan best at the time of her unfortunate <clears his throat>...accident.
<George looks at Wyck suspiciously.>
New scene - George and Jerry at the coffee shop later that day.

JERRY
He cleared his throat?

GEORGE
Yes!

JERRY
So?

GEORGE
He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident." 

JERRY
Not getting it.

GEORGE
Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!

JERRY
Oh, help me, Rhonda.

GEORGE
What time is it?

JERRY (LOOKS AT HIS WATCH)
1:15.

GEORGE
Right now?

JERRY
I gotta go meet Pam.

GEORGE
Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?

JERRY
Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.

GEORGE
Where's Elaine?

JERRY
She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?

GEORGE
What's with all these people having babies?

JERRY
Perpetuation of the species. 

GEORGE
Yeah! Right!

JERRY
By the way, just for the record -

GEORGE
No, I did not! <They exit the coffee shop.>
Commercial break.
New scene - Elaine at her apartment with Carol, Gail and Lisa.

CAROL
..but because it comes out of your baby, it smells good!

ELAINE
Well, that's...that's sweet.

GAIL
Being a mother has made me feel so beautiful.

CAROL
Elaine, you gotta have a baby!

ELAINE
Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...

LISA
Elaine. Move to Long Island and have a baby already.

ELAINE
I really like the city.

CAROL
The city's a toilet. When's the last time you saw my little Adam?

ELAINE
Uh, it was in the Hamptons.

CAROL
Oh! I have pictures!

ELAINE
No, no, that's okay, it's uh...

CAROL (SHOWS ELAINE AND THE GIRLS PICTURES OF ADAM)
Look at him! Just look at him!
<Elaine is revolted by the sight of "breathtaking" little Adam.>
New scene - Jerry and George walking down the street after leaving Monk's.

JERRY
So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...

GEORGE
Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?

JERRY
You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?

GEORGE
Jerry Lewis?

JERRY
I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.

GEORGE
That's pretty paranoid.

JERRY
Yes, it is.

GEORGE
I like it!

JERRY
I thought you might.
New scene - Kramer in Jerry's apartment. Pam enters.

PAM
Oh, hi! I'm Pam. You must be Kramer. <Kramer is smitten with Pam and grins goofily.> Jerry's told me a lot about you. <Kramer continues grinning.> Well, I'm supposed to meet Jerry, it's my day off. I work in a bookstore.

KRAMER (MOUTHS THE WORDS)
Books. <Knocks over a bowl of fruit on the counter.>

PAM
Oh, careful! <Jerry enters.>

JERRY
Hi, sorry I'm late.

PAM
That's okay. Kramer let me in. 

JERRY
You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.

PAM
Okay. <Touches Kramer's hand> It was really nice meeting you.
<Jerry and Pam leave. Kramer sniffs his hand where Pam touched him, and makes a delighted noise.>
New scene - Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.

KRAMER
I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.

NEWMAN
Go on.

KRAMER
Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.

NEWMAN
Ah, yes. Forbidden love.

KRAMER
She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.

NEWMAN
"Pam." I don't know the woman, but she sounds quite fetching.

KRAMER
I can't even speak in front of her. <Sits down on the couch.>

NEWMAN
Jerry! What could she possibly see in Jerry? <Walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet.>

KRAMER
She has delicate beauty.

NEWMAN
Jerry wouldn't know delicate beauty if it bludgeoned him over the head.

KRAMER
And yet, he's my friend.

NEWMAN
And therein lies the tragedy. For I believe, sadly for you, that there is but one woman meant for each of us. One perfect angel for whom we are put on this earth.

KRAMER
Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.

NEWMAN
One winsome tulip we ceaselessly yearn for throughout our dreary, workaday lives! And you, my friend, have found your angel. I can tell. For my heart has also been captured by a breathless beauty - whom I fear I will never possess.

KRAMER
I thought we were talking about me.

NEWMAN
Right. Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.

KRAMER
Confront Jerry? I can't.

NEWMAN
You must!

KRAMER
I won't!

NEWMAN
You will!
New scene - Jerry, Elaine and George at a newsstand.

ELAINE (TO JERRY, IMITATING CAROL)
"Elaine, ya gotta have a baby." Ugh. 

GEORGE
Where are all the poetry magazines?

ELAINE
The New Yorker has poetry.

GEORGE
Yes. The New Yorker.

JERRY
Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?

ELAINE
They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.

JERRY
C'mon, you want to have a baby.

ELAINE
Why? Because I can? 

JERRY
It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?

ELAINE
Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!

KEVIN
I couldn't help overhearing what you were saying. 

ELAINE
Oh, I'm sorry.

KEVIN
No, no, I think I agree with you. I mean, all this talk about having babies.

ELAINE
Yeah, like you must procreate.

KEVIN
Besides, anyone can do it.

ELAINE
Oh, it's been done to death. <smiles>
New scene - George in another meeting at the Foundation. He has a briefcase with a tape recorder in it.

GEORGE
I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.

WYCK
Are you okay, George?

GEORGE
No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. <Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.> Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. <Gets up and leaves the meeting.>
<George is shown standing on the street while the tape rolls inside the briefcase.>
Cut back to the Foundation meeting.

WYCK
..and the stock options for this year look quite, uh... <George returns and retrieves the briefcase.>

GEORGE (APOLOGETIC)
Briefcase. <Shrugs and exits.>
New scene - Elaine and Kevin at the coffee shop.

ELAINE
So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?

KEVIN
Not at all. 

ELAINE
'Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. <Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.> You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. <To Kevin> Right? Am I right? <Kramer walks by.> Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. <Kramer and Kevin shake hands.> Oh, you got a little, uh...

KRAMER (WIPES CHOCOLATE OFF HIS FACE)
Oh, I just had two double-fudge sundaes.

ELAINE
Oh. Are you alright?

KRAMER
Yeah, I'll be okay.

ELAINE
You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.

KRAMER
Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.

ELAINE
Oh, no...that won't last.

KRAMER
What do you mean?

ELAINE
He's not ga-ga.
<Kramer suddenly looks elated and runs out.>
New scene - George shows up at Jerry's apartment later that night with the briefcase.

GEORGE
Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! <Notices that the briefcase is damaged.> Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.

JERRY
How long did you leave it up there?

GEORGE
Five minutes. What the hell happened here?

JERRY
Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.

GEORGE
I have to rewind it first. <George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.> Alright, alright. 
<George plays back the tape. We hear a voice ask, "Did anyone notice George's fingernails?" Then a female voice answering, "Oh my, yes. They looked like they were eaten away by weavels." The male voice remarks, "It's warm in here. Open a window." Then, "Hey! What are you doing?" The female voice exclaims, "Dear God." There's a clunking sound on the tape, and the recording ends.>

JERRY
Is that it?

GEORGE
Stopped dead.

JERRY
What do you make of it?

GEORGE
I don't know. <George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.>

KRAMER
Jerry. Uh, can we talk?

GEORGE (TO KRAMER)
Kinda busy here.

KRAMER
I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.

GEORGE
Why can't I stay?

KRAMER
Because it doesn't concern you.

GEORGE
Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. <Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.>

JERRY
So, what's on your mind?

KRAMER
It's Pam.

JERRY
Pam? What about Pam?

KRAMER
I love her, Jerry!

JERRY
You what?

KRAMER
I love her! 

JERRY
Is that right?

KRAMER
Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.

JERRY
What does that mean?

KRAMER
Oh, and that voice! 

JERRY
What about her name?

KRAMER
Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. <Kramer sits on the couch.> Pam. Pam. Pam!

JERRY
She's got really nice hair.

KRAMER
Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.

JERRY
You've got really specific tastes.

KRAMER
Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.

JERRY
She's got nice calves.

KRAMER
Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...

JERRY
Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.

KRAMER
No you can't, Jerry.

JERRY
But I might. 

KRAMER
Oh, no you don't.

JERRY
Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon? 

KRAMER
What...?

JERRY
I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!

KRAMER (FRANTIC)
Huh?

JERRY
Pam!

KRAMER
Huh?

JERRY
Pam!

KRAMER
Huh-yah! <Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.>
Commercial break.
New scene - Kramer and Newman in Newman's apartment.

KRAMER
So now he wants her more than ever!

NEWMAN
Blast!

KRAMER
What am I gonna do, huh?

NEWMAN
Don't despair, my friend. <Newman walks in front of Kramer and trips over his feet. Again.> I won't allow your love to go unrequited. Not like mine.

KRAMER
What, again with you?

NEWMAN
Sorry. But love is spice with many tastes. A dizzying array of textures...and moments.

KRAMER
If only I could say things like that around her.

NEWMAN (GETTING AN IDEA)
Yes...
New scene - Elaine and George at the coffee shop listening to the briefcase tape.

ELAINE
Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!

ELAINE
..followed by a mysterious...'glonk.'

GEORGE
It's baffling, isn't it?

ELAINE
Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?

GEORGE
They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. <Jerry comes over to the table.>

JERRY
That Pam! I am ga-ga over her!

ELAINE
Ga-ga? When did that happen?

JERRY
Yesterday. Six-ish.

ELAINE
Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.

JERRY
You just met the guy yesterday.

ELAINE
Yeah, but we have a common goal.

JERRY
A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?

ELAINE (HAPPILY)
Yeah.

GEORGE
And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.

ELAINE
Yeah, of course.

JERRY
Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.

ELAINE
Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.

GEORGE
Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon my French."

JERRY
I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.

GEORGE
I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.
New scene - Kramer and Newman in an aisle at the bookstore where Pam works.

NEWMAN
With your looks and my words, we'll have built the perfect beast. <Kramer claps him on the shoulder, then goes to the other side of the aisle to talk to Pam.>

PAM
Oh, hi! Kramer.

NEWMAN (WHISPERS THROUGH THE BOOKCASE)
Hi. How are you?

KRAMER
Hi. How are you?

PAM
I'm great.

NEWMAN
I too am well.

KRAMER
I too am well.

NEWMAN
Do I smell Pantene?

KRAMER
Do I smell?

NEWMAN
Pantene!

KRAMER
Uh, Pantene. 

PAM
Oh, my shampoo. Yeah, it is Pantene, I got a free sample in with my junk mail.

KRAMER (TALKS RAPIDLY IN AN ATTEMPT TO KEEP UP WITH NEWMAN)
Well, there really is no junk-mail...well, everybody wants to get a check or a birthday card, but...

NEWMAN (FRANTIC)
..it takes just as much man-power to deliver it as their precious little greeting cards...

KRAMER
Newman! <Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.>

PAM
What?

KRAMER
Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance. 

PAM
That's so true.

KRAMER
Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...

NEWMAN
Shell.

KRAMER
..shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.

PAM
Kramer, that is so lovely.

KRAMER
It's by an unknown 20th-century poet.

PAM
Oh, what's his name?

KRAMER
Newman. <On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.>
New scene - Elaine and Kevin in Elaine's apartment.

KEVIN
Elaine, you've changed my life.

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.

KEVIN
I got a vasectomy this morning.

ELAINE
Although, I have a hunch you mean it.
New scene - Jerry talking with Pam at the bookstore.

JERRY
I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.

PAM
Oh. Well, that's um...<clears her throat>...nice. <Jerry looks suspicious. Pam turns around and Jerry notices her tortoise clip has been replaced with a velvet scrunchie.>

JERRY'S BRAIN
A velvet scrunchie!

JERRY
Kramer!
New scene - Jerry approaching his apartment door. He meets Newman coming out of Kramer's place.
    

JERRY
Hello, Newman.

NEWMAN
Hello, Jerry. How's Pam?

JERRY
Pam? What do you care? <Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.>

NEWMAN
Well, ta-ta! <Scampers away.>

JERRY
Wait a minute! <A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.>

JERRY
Alright, Newman! This is it! <Shoves him against the wall.>

NEWMAN (SWEATING)
Easy, Jerry. Steady. You wouldn't want to lose your cool at a time like this. 

JERRY
Why not?

NEWMAN
Because right now, I'm the only chance you've got. <Newman giggles nervously. Jerry makes Newman flinch, and his giggling is choked off.>

JERRY (ROLLS HIS EYES)
C'mon. <They exit.>
New scene - Jerry and Newman in Newman's apartment.

JERRY
I can't believe I'm losing Pam!

NEWMAN
I know how you feel. For I, too, have a woman for whom I pine.

JERRY
I thought we were talking about me.

NEWMAN
Right.

JERRY
Anyway, I don't need your help. <Turns to leave.>

NEWMAN
Oh, don't you? Joke boy? You really think you can manipulate that beautiful young woman like the half-soused nightclub rabble that lap up your inane "observations"?

JERRY
Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?

NEWMAN
Well, there is a little something you can do for me...

JERRY
C'mon, out with it.

NEWMAN
It's about...Elaine.

JERRY
Elaine? What does she have to - <notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.> Oh no...

NEWMAN
You dated her. Give me some inside information. Anything I can use!

JERRY (SHRUGS)
Well, I know she doesn't want to have kids. <Newman considers the implications of this.>
Cut back to Elaine and Kevin at Elaine's apartment.

KEVIN
I thought you'd be a little more enthusiastic about it.

ELAINE
I know, I don't want...<clears her throat>...kids.

KEVIN
What was that?

ELAINE
Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.

KEVIN
This is! Oh boy, I always do this.

ELAINE
What?

KEVIN
Oh, I get all jazzed up about something and I go way to far with it. 

ELAINE
Really?

KEVIN
Oh, yeah. Like last summer. I'm watchin' TV and I saw one of those jet-skis. $4000 later and it's sitting in my garage.

ELAINE
You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...

KEVIN
Sometimes I think I do want kids. Maybe a lot of kids!

ELAINE
Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short. 

KEVIN
Yeah! I think I like short hair. Really short.

ELAINE
Yeah!

KEVIN
Yeah!
New scene - Jerry and George in Jerry's kitchen. George has brought over a model of the conference room at the Foundation.

GEORGE
This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.

JERRY
When did you build this thing?

GEORGE
Yesterday, took the day off. <Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.> Now, from the time I left the room...

JERRY (POINTS AT THE POWER RANGER)
Wait, that's you?

GEORGE
Yeah.

JERRY (PICKS UP A YELLOW M&M TOY FROM THE MODEL)
I really think the M&M should be you.

GEORGE (GRABS THE M&M AWAY FROM JERRY)
Alright, whatever! Now. Whatever caused the damage...<drops a tiny briefcase onto the table in the model>...was jarring enough to completely stop the tape.

JERRY
And?

GEORGE
Okay. That's what we know.

JERRY
But we already knew that. 

GEORGE
Well, yeah.

JERRY
Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.

GEORGE
I don't know if you're ready for it.

JERRY
Please.

GEORGE
I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never - 

JERRY
Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. <The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.> Yeah?

VOICE ON SPEAKER
It's Pam.

JERRY
C'mon up. <To George> Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'

GEORGE
I'm not through here, Jerry. <Picks up the model of the conference room.> I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. <Pam enters, George leaves.>

PAM
What was that?

JERRY
We were just playin.'

PAM
Listen, I had a long talk with Kramer today...

JERRY
Uh huh...

PAM
Well, the thing is, I uh...I think I have a little crush on him. <Kramer slides in the door on his knees.>

KRAMER
I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!

JERRY (TO PAM)
This is the man you have a crush on?

PAM
Well, I have feelings for both of you.

KRAMER
How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.

JERRY
Why can't I be a soul mate?

KRAMER
Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?

PAM
Children? Who said anything about children? I don't want to have children.
<Jerry and Kramer look at each other, puzzled.>
New scene - George back at the conference room at the Foundation.

GEORGE
There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.

WYCK
George...

GEORGE
You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. <Plays back the tape.> That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.

WYCK
George, Quinn here was moving a chair...he lost his balance and dropped it...it must have fallen on your briefcase, which, for some reason, contained a running tape recorder?

GEORGE
Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.
New scene - Jerry and Newman in the office of Bernard Wendroff, M.D. - urologist. Elaine and Kevin enter. Elaine has cut her hair short.

ELAINE
What are you guys doing here?

JERRY
We're getting vasectomies.

ELAINE
Why?

NEWMAN (TO ELAINE)
I'm doing it for you.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY (TO ELAINE)
What'd you do to your hair?

ELAINE
I cut it.

JERRY
It's a little short.

KEVIN
Y'think?

JERRY (TO KEVIN)
What are you doing here?

ELAINE
Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.

JERRY AND NEWMAN
Reversed?! <Kramer comes hobbling out of the doctors office in pain, after having a vasectomy of his own, and exits. Jerry and Newman look at each other, and bolt for the door themselves.>
Commercial break.
New scene - George reading the poem for Susan at the Foundation.

GEORGE
..he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.

WYCK
Is that a Keats poem?

GEORGE
No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. <Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.>

WYCK
Does anyone think George might have murdered Susan?

MR. CROSS
Oh, yeah. I just assumed he murdered her.

MS. BAINES
Of course he killed her.

WYCK
So it's not just me, then. Alright! Back to business.
End.
[JERRY and GEORGE are eating at an outdoor table, possibly in a zoo.]

JERRY
All right. How 'bout this one: let's say you're abducted by aliens.

GEORGE
Fine.

JERRY
They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now: would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?

GEORGE
I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.

JERRY
But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!

GEORGE
I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..

JERRY
[resigned] At least it's show business..

GEORGE
But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.

JERRY
What if she's got no interest in you?

GEORGE
W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.

[TIME
00:43]
[Commercial Break]

[EXTERIOR LONG SHOT
looking up at an office building]
[Interior of office reception area of "Brand/Leland" as GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER come in. They calmly keep it quiet.]

KRAMER
George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?

GEORGE
Krama, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!

KRAMER
[frustrated] Wha??

JERRY
[dry] He knows.

GEORGE
{Anyway,} on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! [imitates sound] Ha ha!

KRAMER
[impressed] Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.

GEORGE
You sure?

JERRY
[dry] He knows.
[KRAMER goes on his mission and they're waiting for the elevator as the RECEPTIONIST calmly arrives, not noticing them.
She could be a model.]

GEORGE
Wow.
Nice.

JERRY
Why don't you try your engagement story?

GEORGE
[considers, but got into elevator] Won't work.

JERRY
Are you sure?

GEORGE
[wry] He knows.
[Reggie's diner. ELAINE and KEVIN, a geekish nice guy in a red jacket, are eating at a table. ELAINE is a little bored,
dreading.]

ELAINE
Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. [takes a bite of her
sandwich]

KEVIN
Friends?

ELAINE
Well. I mean. [distracted by the food] Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.

KEVIN
Friends. Yeah! Why not friends? I might like to try that! Like you an' Jerry!
[Men's room door. Flush sound and "Wooo!".]
[Down the hall, a MAN in a suit is trying to use the copier as KRAMER comes out of the men's room affecting nonchalance.]

MAN
[frustrated] Damn thing is jammed again..

KRAMER
You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. [hits button several times and whacks it]
MAN #2
[rushing by, tense] Hey Leland wants everyone in the conference room right now.

MAN
Come on, let's go.

KRAMER
[absently wants to be part of it] Oh, yeah--yeah.. [follows them]
[Monk's. GEORGE, JERRY, and ELAINE at a booth.]

ELAINE
[to JERRY] Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you
should give her a call.

JERRY
[doubtful] I don't know, do you have a--
[ELAINE has anticipated the question, gives him her picture.]

JERRY
Not bad. Wuh--what does she--

ELAINE
[dry] I put her stats on the back.

JERRY
Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president: James Polk!" [ELAINE had

ECHOED
"Uh-huh. Yup." during it]

GEORGE
Hnn! Let me see that.

JERRY
[hands it to him as he asks ELAINE] So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?

ELAINE
[laughs in appreciation] You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really
wants to be friends.

JERRY
Why would anybody want a friend.

ELAINE
[dread] Uh.
It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never
ever do.

JERRY
I mean all that stuff is so small..
[(ELAINE is wryly assessing him)]
stupid..

GEORGE
[still looking at that picture] You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance..

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been
inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come
and go as I please!

ELAINE
[wry, not impressed] Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to
move the whole damn forbidden city. [chuckles with JERRY]

GEORGE
[getting up] Can I keep this?

ELAINE
No, I need it.

GEORGE
[absently leaving with it] Thanks.
[The Brand/Leland office reception area. GEORGE comes in off elevator to the RECEPTIONIST (AMANDA).]

GEORGE
Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..

AMANDA
I'm sorry sir, there is no Mr. Vandelay here..

GEORGE
[taking out wallet] Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh!
Seems--oh! I, oh! [has conveniently dropped the photo into her view]

AMANDA
Oh! She's beautiful! Who is she?

GEORGE
[humble] Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiance, Susan. May she rest in peace.

AMANDA
Oh, sorry.. She was lovely. I'm Amanda.

GEORGE
[shaking hands] I'm George.
[As they continue talking, MAN3 and KRAMER go to the elevator.]
MAN3
Good work today, K-man!

KRAMER
Well, you know what they say, you don't sell the steak, you sell the sizzle.
MAN3
Heh, heh!

KRAMER
{You want a drink? I'm buyin'.}
MAN3
In that case, make mine a double!
[They yuck it up, getting on the elevator.]
[Night at a restaurant. JERRY and GILLIAN meet.]

GILLIAN
Jerry?

JERRY
Gillian. Hiii..

GILLIAN
Very nice to meet you.

JERRY
It's nice to meet you!
[They're shaking hands and he notices hers are like a man's--nice enough, but big, beefy.]
[Day, at Monk's. JERRY and ELAINE are in a booth.]

JERRY
She had man-hands.

ELAINE
[pause] Man, Hands?

JERRY
The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.

ELAINE
[weary] {Look,} would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?

JERRY
Would she have hooks?

ELAINE
Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?

JERRY
Kinda cool lookin'..

ELAINE
[getting up to go] Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my {place tomorrow}--

JERRY
[leaving too] Yeah. Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of {buttons}.

JERRY
Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--

ELAINE
[weary] Jerry!
[Early morning in Jerry's "house," a tea kettle is whistling. KRAMER's cooking breakfast as JERRY comes out of the bedroom,
tired but surprised. He's in his pajamas. KRAMER's wearing a suit and oven mitts.]

JERRY
Kramer?!

KRAMER
Hey buddy! Hey!

JERRY
It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!

KRAMER
Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.

JERRY
Why??

KRAMER
Because I'm workin' there, that's why.

JERRY
[disoriented] How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?

KRAMER
Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?

JERRY
[snaps fingers] Now that you mention it.

KRAMER
But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm
workin' with.

JERRY
How much are they payin' you?

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay.
I'm doin' this just for me.

JERRY
Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?

KRAMER
T.C.B.
You know, takin' care o' business.
Aa--I gotta go.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
[leaving] I'll see you tonight, huh? [turning back, grabs his briefcase] Forget my briefcase.

JERRY
W-w-wha' you got in there?

KRAMER
[as he leaves with it] Crackers.

[MUSIC (SHEENA EASTON'S "MORNING TRAIN (NINE TO FIVE)") ACCOMPANIES ASSORTED SHOTS OF WORKING-MAN KRAMER
Getting on the subway (everyone else is going the opposite direction).
Washing his shoes at the water cooler.
Eating rolls of crackers out of his briefcase.
Laughing it up after hours with co-workers at a TGIF-type restaurant.]
[JERRY at home on the phone. GEORGE is on the other end.]

JERRY
So the picture worked. Amazing!

GEORGE
Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you don't have it.

GEORGE
Right. Bye.
[ELAINE comes in, appalled, shrugging at JERRY. He doesn't know why so shrugs back.]

ELAINE
Where were you today?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Pick. Up.

JERRY
[whispers] Damn.

ELAINE
So? Where were you?!

JERRY
Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.

ELAINE
[irritated, throwing down her bag] I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!

JERRY
So? What are friends for?

ELAINE
Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.

JERRY
So he's Bizarro Jerry!

ELAINE
[pause] Bizarro Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is
Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.

ELAINE
[pause] Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?

JERRY
No. It's still a goodbye.

ELAINE
Uh. Does he live underwater?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
Is he black..

JERRY
Look. Just, forget it, {already}. All right?
[KRAMER enters, exhausted, frazzled.]

KRAMER
Wow. Man. What a day.
Could I use a drink. [starts getting a drink and ice]

JERRY
Tough day at the office?

KRAMER
Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.

JERRY
Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine,
I'm toast.. [{takes a swig and reacts}]
[Exterior of cheap-looking bar with neon "V"s on the outside. Then interior, it's a black-walled dance bar full of gorgeous
women and GEORGE and AMANDA.]

GEORGE
This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!
[Three female MODELS come up to them.]
MODEL #1
Hey! Amanda!

AMANDA
These are my friends. Anabelle, Justina, and Nikki. We used to model together.

GEORGE
Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. [to self in head] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

AMANDA
So Nikki, uh, how was Paris this time?
MODEL #2
[petulant] A bore.

GEORGE
You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiance, Susan.. [opening wallet] In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her..
[shows them the picture]
MODEL #3
[awed] Wow.. She was beautiful.. Do you wanna dance?

[Close-up of GILLIAN's man-hands tearing restaurant bread in half.]
[GILLIAN and JERRY at a table in a restaurant. JERRY's hiding his horror of her hands.]

GILLIAN
Would you like some bread, Jerry?

JERRY
No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.

GILLIAN
Well, then at least drink your beer.. [she's opening the bottle--brief closeup on hands]

JERRY
[to self] It's not a... Twist off.

GILLIAN
You have a little something on your face.

JERRY
I can get it. [feeling his face]

GILLIAN
Eh, no-no, No-no.. You're missing it, it's higher. [reaches over]
[A close-up of his face while a man-hand is getting the very small thing. He's uneasy.]

GILLIAN
[friendly] It's an eyelash. Make a wish.
[Closeup of his face with her outstretched finger in front of him.]

JERRY
I don't want to.

GILLIAN
Make a wish.

JERRY
Okay. [closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self] Didn't come true.

GILLIAN
[smiles at him] Don't you just love lobster?
[Closeup of her man-hands tearing open a lobster.]
[Night, ELAINE and KEVIN walking into Reggie's diner.]

KEVIN
That Museum of Miniatures was amazing.

ELAINE
I know, he's so tiny!
[Two guys are sitting in a booth and KEVIN sees them, motioning ELAINE to come along.]

KEVIN
Yeah! Hey--hey guys! Elaine, sit down. These are a couple o' my friends. Uh, this is Gene. And this guy, we.. just call
"Feldman!"
[GENE is short and bald with glasses. Feldman is tall and a little goofy-looking. ELAINE sits with them.]

ELAINE
[to self in head] Bizarro world..

[TIME
10:33]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, JERRY and GEORGE at Monk's.]

GEORGE
[delighted] Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!

JERRY
Then it does exist.

GEORGE
Yes. The legends are true.

JERRY
So when are you goin' out with this girl again?

GEORGE
I'm not! I'm inside the walls!

JERRY
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

GEORGE
Flame on!
[Reggie's, FELDMAN, GENE, and KEVIN are at a booth when ELAINE comes and sits with them.]

GENE
[about the check] I got it.

KEVIN
[grabs it] No. You got it last time.

GENE
[calmly takes it] Don't worry about it.

ELAINE
[to self in head] This is unbelievable..

FELDMAN
Hey Elaine, what do you think of an alarm clock, that automatically tells you the weather when you wake up?

ELAINE
Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!

FELDMAN
Nah, it's not--it's just not practical.

KEVIN
[getting up] Well. See ya later, Elaine. Feldman an' I 'a' gotta get down 'o the library. [the three guys are leaving]

ELAINE
What are you gonna do down there?

KEVIN
Read!

ELAINE
[pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave] Hello?
[At Jerry's, JERRY and KRAMER eating breakfast. KRAMER's tired, preoccupied with the paper, JERRY's in a blue robe
eating cereal and orange juice.]

JERRY
So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

JERRY
Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George "The Animal" Steele.

KRAMER
Yeah..

JERRY
Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.

KRAMER
That's nice..

JERRY
Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!

KRAMER
Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--

JERRY
I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--

KRAMER
Oh here we go--

JERRY
An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!

KRAMER
What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!

JERRY
[pause] It's your third day..

KRAMER
[grabs briefcase to leave] I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. [leaves]

JERRY
Well.
[calling down the hall] Call if you're gonna be late!
[ELAINE's arrived.]

ELAINE
What? What is goin' on with you two?

JERRY
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..

ELAINE
All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- [sees address book on counter] --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later.
[leaving]

JERRY
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.

ELAINE
[stops, pause] Well, I.
[a little ashamed] I guess I been at Reggie's..

JERRY
The Bizarro coffeeshop?

ELAINE
Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..

JERRY
I read.

ELAINE
Books, Jerry.

JERRY
[pause] Oh.
Big deal..

ELAINE
Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating
minutia, of every, single, daily event..

JERRY
{What's goin' on,} like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--

ELAINE
I'll see you later man. I gotta go.

JERRY
[frustrated, to self] The whole system is breakin' down!
[GEORGE in his bathroom, drying his hair, looking at Gillian's picture. In the background, on a door, is a poster of a closeup of
Dennis Franz in black and white. The phone rings and GEORGE puts the picture and blow-drier together on the side of the
sink--the dryer's still running.]

GEORGE
Hello?
Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now.
Bye-bye. [hangs up]
[happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo] No! No!
[At Jerry's, JERRY and GILLIAN.]

GILLIAN
Friends. Just friends.

JERRY
Yeah.

GILLIAN
Yeah.
All right. Well, do you still want to see a movie later?

JERRY
I wish I could, but, we're friends..

GILLIAN
I'm just gonna go, wash my hands.

JERRY
Good idea. [phone's ringing, goes to it]
[muttering] There's a beach towel on the rack..
[to phone] Yeah.

GEORGE
[frantic] Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the
forbidden city!

JERRY
[to drive him crazy] Who is this..

GEORGE
Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man-hands. I'm beggin' you!

JERRY
[pause] If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?

GEORGE
Yes! Yes, all right--anything!
[JERRY looks toward the bathroom--GILLIAN's taking forever--she's got quite a job there. He opens her purse and peeks
around in it. Close-up of his hand getting the picture.]

JERRY
Got it. [but now a man-hand grabs his arm] Uh!
[Jerry's house, it's dark, JERRY is sitting at the table waiting up as KRAMER comes in and turns on the light.]

KRAMER
Jerry. Hey Jerry?

JERRY
I'm right here. [note: he has an athletic bandage on his right hand]
You're late.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?

JERRY
Like you care.

KRAMER
The work piled up, I lost track of time--

JERRY
[calmly getting up with plate of chicken] Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only
calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, [drops chicken into
sink] was, for two.

KRAMER
You cooked?

JERRY
[calm] I ordered in. It's still effort.

KRAMER
[in pain] Ow! Jeez!

JERRY
What's wrong?

KRAMER
{Ow!} It's my stomach.

JERRY
You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.

KRAMER
[putting briefcase down] You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out
tonight? Any place you want.

JERRY
The coffeeshop?

KRAMER
You got it, buddy.

JERRY
[pleased] I'll call George!
[Night exterior. GEORGE, JERRY, and KRAMER walking down the street. Down the sidewalk is ELAINE coming out of a
shop by a liquor store.]

JERRY
Hey. Isn't that Elaine?

GEORGE
[quiet, desperate] Maybe she can get me another picture of man-hands.
[calling] Elaine!

JERRY
Elaine!

KRAMER
Elaine!

ALL THREE
Elaine! Elaine!

[ELAINE FINALLY NOTICES THEM, BUT SUDDENLY FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION, THREE OTHER GUYS ARE COMING
GENE, KEVIN, and
FELDMAN.]

KEVIN
Hey! Elaine!
Hi-i! Over here!
[Eerie music as ELAINE looks one way, then the other. All the MEN continue walking toward her. They all meet by her. To
the left of ELAINE are KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN. To the right of her are KRAMER, GEORGE, and JERRY. It's like
a bizarre mirroring.]

ELAINE
Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.
[The MEN murmur "How ya doin'..", "Good to meet you.."]

JERRY
[quietly crept out] This is really weird..
[KRAMER's drinking--a bottle of Pepto Bismol.]

ELAINE
[diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN] Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.

KEVIN
Sure. [strolls away with his friends]

ELAINE
[pause] Thanks. [to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER] What.. what do you guys want..

GEORGE
Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.

JERRY
I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
[While the three argue briefly, ELAINE looks over to see where KEVIN and FRIENDS are. They are friendly giving a beggar
money.]

KEVIN
{Here ya are.}

ELAINE
[pause, turns back to JERRY et al.] Guys. I gotta go.
Take it easy.
[GEORGE tentatively follows her a couple steps.]

GEORGE
Elaine?
[she turns, sighing]
Can I come?

ELAINE
I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..
[KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN cheerily/nicely turn to ELAINE as she joins them. They all go on companionably. JERRY,
GEORGE, and KRAMER look on awkwardly.]
[Day, interior of Brand/Leland, KRAMER's in LELAND's office. LELAND's a greying man.]

KRAMER
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?

LELAND
Kramer, I've.. been reviewing your work.. Quite frankly, it stinks.

KRAMER
Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..

LELAND
No, no, I don't think that's going to, do it, uh. These reports you handed in. It's almost as if you have no business training at all..
I don't know what this is supposed to be!

KRAMER
Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..

LELAND
Well, I'm sorry. There's just no way that we could keep you on.

KRAMER
I don't even really work here!

LELAND
That's what makes this so difficult.
[Night, GEORGE at the forbidden city.]

GEORGE
Hi. George.
MODEL #4
Are you sure you're supposed to be here?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiance, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her
picture. [hands her a magazine page]
MODEL #4
What'd you do? Cut this out of a magazine or something?

GEORGE
Huh?
MODEL #5
That's me? It's from a Clinique ad I did..

GEORGE
Ha! Heh.
[Muscled BOUNCER comes up.]

BOUNCER
Let's go. Private party. [escorts him out]
[Night, Kevin's apartment. The doorbell rings. KEVIN gets up to get it. GENE is reading on the couch. The apartment layout
and furniture is the reverse of Jerry's--what's to the left in Jerry's is to the right at Kevin's. Also, Kevin's furnishings have more
earth tones.]

KEVIN
Who is it?

ELAINE
[off-camera] It's Lainey!

KEVIN
[unlocks, opens door]
Hi Elaine! [warmly hugs her]

ELAINE
Hi {?}. Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!

KEVIN
Come on in!

ELAINE
Okay. Hi Gene! [comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor] Uh-ha! [smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair
that's to the right]
[As KEVIN gets back to reading, ELAINE looks around, noting how everything is the reverse. There's a unicycle on the wall.
There's a bookcase near the couch. She goes to the kitchen. He has whole foods, not cereal boxes.]

ELAINE
What's up?

KEVIN
[friendly] Just reading..
[ELAINE decides to make herself at home, opens the refrigerator and starts eating olives out of a jar, with her fingers. In the

LIVING ROOM AREA, KEVIN IS LOOKING AT HER. NOTE
a statue of Bizarro Superman on a stereo speaker.]

KEVIN
Hey.. What're you doing?

ELAINE
Eatin' olives.

KEVIN
Have you ever heard of asking? [door bell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off-screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[drops his suspicion and smiles, goes to door] Hold on. [unlocks and opens door]
Hey.

FELDMAN
He-ey, Kevin!

KEVIN
Hi.

FELDMAN
Look who I ran into.
[VARGUS, a heavy Fed-Ex guy comes into view in the hall.]

VARGUS
[testy] Hello, Kevin..

KEVIN
[testy] Hello, Vargus..
[They both break into grins, chuckling--it was a joke.]

KEVIN
Ya wanna catch a ballgame this weekend?

VARGUS
Great! I'll see ya later! [leaves]

KEVIN
Okay. [to self, smiling] Vargus..
[to FELDMAN] {So?}

FELDMAN
I got 'em..

KEVIN
All right! Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi!

ELAINE
Oh! [comes to him]

KEVIN
[enthused] Fourth row, center.

ELAINE
Get out! [pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!]
[GENE and FELDMAN rush to KEVIN, who's hurt!]

GENE
[to ELAINE] What is the matter with you?

ELAINE
Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
GENE?
Haven't you done enough already?
[Embarrassed, she grabs her bag and tries to leave. But the locks are set and the rape chain's in place. She tries to undo the
locks.]

ELAINE
[turning to them, awkward] It's locked..
[The meat-packing plant. GEORGE and JERRY are walking around. The walls are still black, but there's no furniture and there
are sides of beef hanging on hooks, sawdust on the floor. They are the only people there. GEORGE is dismayed, and bumps
into a side of beef in his distraction.]

JERRY
So this is it, huh?

GEORGE
But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..

JERRY
[dry] I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw?
[really disappointed] Get out of here George.
[Shot of their feet in the sawdust as they walk out. There is the magazine photo GEORGE had brought there the previous night.]

[TIME
10:52]
[Commercial Break]
[Day, exterior of an apartment building. As credits run, the familiar Seinfeld interlude music, but done via corny "Brady
Bunch"-esque sound effects.]
[Interior of Kevin's apartment. GENE and KEVIN are talking.]

GENE
At work today, I discovered there's a payphone in the lobby that has free long distance.

KEVIN
Oh, so what did you do?

GENE
I called the phone company an' immediately reported the error.

KEVIN
Nice.
[doorbell rings]
Who is it?

FELDMAN
[off-screen] Feldman..
From across the hall.

KEVIN
[smiles, relieved] Hold on.
[GENE's arranging fruit as KEVIN goes to unlock and open the door. FELDMAN's carrying two paper bags of groceries.]

FELDMAN
Kevin! Brought some groceries.

KEVIN
Again?! Feldman, you didn't have to do that!

FELDMAN
Hey, what are friends for?

KEVIN
You know, I may not say this enough but you two are about the best friends a guy could have.
[They have a long smarmy group hug.]
KEVIN
[eyes closed in hug] Oh.
Me so happy. Me want to cry.
End.
Jerry and Kramer walking down the street. Jerry is closest to the street.

KRAMER
I wouldn't walk over there.

JERRY
Why not?

KRAMER
It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've
had your last egg sandwich.

JERRY
What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.

KRAMER
I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.

JERRY
No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips,
prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.

KRAMER
Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.

JERRY
You were livin' in the village then, right?

KRAMER
Don't really remember.
% Coffee shop, Jerry and Elaine

ELAINE
(Showing fingernails) Toxic waste green.

JERRY
That is disgusting.

ELAINE
You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.

JERRY
Well, then you're drivin' me wild.

ELAINE
I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.

JERRY
(George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?

ELAINE
I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.

JERRY
Like with dogs.

ELAINE
Exactly.

GEORGE
Party?

ELAINE
Yeah.

GEORGE
Food?

ELAINE
Uh huh.

GEORGE
Bar?

ELAINE
Yeah.

GEORGE
George?

JERRY
He's gonna show up anyway.

ELAINE
George, I just don't want you interfering.

GEORGE
How could I possibly interfere?

JERRY
Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?
% At Elaine's party...

GEORGE
(Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know,
I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves)
(To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?

ANNA
No thanks.

GEORGE
My name is George.

ANNA
Anna. I don't recall seeing you around the office. Do you work in the mail
room?

GEORGE
No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.

ANNA
Oh. Excuse me. (She leaves)

GEORGE
So...

MAN
How 'bout leading us in a toast?

ELAINE
Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us
well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's
dancin'? You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances)

GEORGE
Sweet Fancy Moses!
% Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters

KRAMER
You get the tickets?

JERRY
Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.

KRAMER
Death Blow: When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are,
but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think
you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?

JERRY
Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?

KRAMER
Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a
personal favor to me.
% Kramer is eating ice cream right out of the container.

JERRY
Yeah I guess I do owe you.

KRAMER
Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?

JERRY
No, I'm okay.

KRAMER
There's no problem, really.

JERRY
I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?

GEORGE
Food was good.

JERRY
So I didn't miss anything?

GEORGE
Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you
ever seen Elaine dance?

JERRY
Elaine danced?

GEORGE
It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.

JERRY
Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?

GEORGE
What, you mean you know about this?

JERRY
For some time. It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her
about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.

GEORGE
Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.

JERRY
And by then you've lost interest.

GEORGE
Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68
GTO.

JERRY
What made him get that thing?

GEORGE
During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.

JERRY
Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer)

KRAMER
Brody's in.

JERRY
I don't even have the extra ticket yet.

KRAMER
Well, you better get on the horn.
% Elaine's office, Elaine on the phone

ELAINE
I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say
the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the
background)

JERRY
How could that be?

ELAINE
Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something
to do with the party?

JERRY
No, George was there, he said he had a great time.

ELAINE
Oh, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.

JERRY
Oh, what are you talkin' about?

ELAINE
He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the
next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.

JERRY
Now you're talkin' crazy!

ELAINE
All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?

JERRY
(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
% Elaine's office, Anna enters

ANNA
You have a minute to approve some copy?

ELAINE
Oh yeah, sure, sure. So, did ya have a good time at the party last night?

ANNA
It was a real... kick.

ELAINE
Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?

ANNA
As a matter of fact I did.

ELAINE
Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.

ANNA
Why? He seems harmless.

ELAINE
Oh he's not. He's very harmful.

ANNA
Really?

ELAINE
Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst
seeds I've ever seen.

ANNA
And you two are friends?

ELAINE
Yeah, we're good friends.
% Coffee shop...

GEORGE
So this Anna called me from out of the blue.

JERRY
Really? I thought you were rebuffed.

GEORGE
With extreme prejudice.

JERRY
Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.

GEORGE
No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of
the worst seeds she'd ever seen.

JERRY
Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a
phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.

GEORGE
I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.

JERRY
You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...

GEORGE
Yes, yes...

JERRY
The bad fianc‚, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...

GEORGE
Okay, the point is made.

JERRY
The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George
exits) The bad tipper!
% At the movies...

JERRY
Half of show business is here.

KRAMER
There's Brody. Brody! Over here.

BRODY
Hey Kramer. And you must be Jerry. Thanks for the ticket.

JERRY
That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.

BRODY
It's for all of us. Is there a problem?

KRAMER
Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.

JERRY
I'm a joke maker.

KRAMER
All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)

JERRY
(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?

KRAMER
Relax, he does that all the time.

JERRY
Does what?

KRAMER
He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, huh?

JERRY
May I see you outside for a moment please?

KRAMER
But I want to--

JERRY
Outside!
% Elaine's office

ELAINE
Hey, have you seen Anna?

WORKER
Uh, she just went to meet your friend George.

ELAINE
To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?

WORKER
The park, why?

ELAINE
Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!
% Outside the theater at the movies.

JERRY
What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?

KRAMER
Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.

JERRY
It's not legitimate.

KRAMER
It's a business.

JERRY
Where did you meet this guy?

KRAMER
He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pinochle--

JERRY
Kramer. (boom sound)

KRAMER
Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!

JERRY
I don't believe this. (They run into theater)
% Anna and George in the park.

ANNA
You know I'm not supposed to be talking to you.

GEORGE
No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?

ANNA
No... a little. Nice car.

GEORGE
Yeah, she's a sweet ride.

ANNA
Is that your orthopedic back pillow?

GEORGE
Maybe.

ANNA
Well is it or isn't it?

GEORGE
Guess not.
% Elaine arrives.

ELAINE
(To George) Stay away from her.

GEORGE
I didn't do nothin'.

ELAINE
(To Anna) Get in the car.

ANNA
But...

ELAINE
You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.

GEORGE
Lighten up.
% As they leave George points and winks at Anna.
% Death Blow...

KRAMER
Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?

BRODY
Uh, I got a cramp.

KRAMER
Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.

BRODY
Uh, there it goes again. Kramer, you gotta drive me home.

JERRY
Hey, what is going on over there?

BRODY
Jerry, finish shooting the movie for me.

JERRY
Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.

KRAMER
Jerry, if the man is in pain...

JERRY
Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.

BRODY
(pulls out a gun) What are you some kind of tough guy?

KRAMER
Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.

JERRY
All right, I'm takin' the camera.

KRAMER
(To Brody) C'mon, let's go.

JERRY
Oh man...
% Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.

KRAMER
Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?

JERRY
How was the rest of Death Blow?

KRAMER
Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy had it comin' to him!

JERRY
Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!

KRAMER
He's quite a character, isn't he?

JERRY
You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!

What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.

KRAMER
Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.

JERRY
What if I didn't do it right?

KRAMER
It's your first time. He'll understand.

JERRY
People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many
misunderstandings.
% Brody enters

KRAMER
Hey, Brody!

JERRY
Hi.

BRODY
Jerry, I have to talk to you about the tape.

JERRY
Yeah.

BRODY
I've never seen such beautiful work. You're a genius. The zoom-ins, the
framing. I was enchanted.

JERRY
Well, I did the best I could.

BRODY
I got another project for you. It's a movie called Cry Cry Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it's an arty movie and quite frankly, they don't have the sensibility.
% Brody's beeper sounds

BRODY
May I use your phone?

KRAMER
Uh yeah. It's under the couch.
% Brody exits to Kramer's apartment.

KRAMER
Look at you! You've got another gig!

JERRY
I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.

KRAMER
But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're
talkin' feature films.

JERRY
We're talkin' federal crime here.
% Brody enters.

BRODY
(To Jerry) I'll expect that tape by three o'clock tomorrow. (To Kramer) May I borrow this? (Holding baseball bat)

KRAMER
Sure, do you need a glove?

BRODY
Nah.
% A meeting at Elaine's office

WORKER
I pressed through the rushes and there, the native dancers whirled before me: limbs flailing, arms akimbo, feet kicking up dust... (All workers laugh)

ELAINE
What?
% Anna enters with Yankee jacket on.

ANNA
Sorry, I got hung up.

ELAINE
At Yankee Stadium?

ANNA
This? It's mine.

ELAINE
Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.

ANNA
He's not stocky.
% Elaine turns around. A paper airplane is thrown at her.

ELAINE
Who did that? Who did that?!?
% Cry, Cry Again, Kramer is bootlegging.

KRAMER
(laughing) The French guy fell off the bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)
% Jerry's apartment watching the tape.

JERRY
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?

KRAMER
That's fine.

JERRY
Do you even know what this scene is about?

KRAMER
It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.

JERRY
No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
(Gesturing taking a loaf of bread.)

KRAMER
Wha? Where?

JERRY
Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.

KRAMER
Nah, he's not going to know the difference.

JERRY
I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.

KRAMER
So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot)

JERRY
I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?

KRAMER
Right here. (Elaine enters)

ELAINE
Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?

KRAMER
(He shows her) This umpf thing.

ELAINE
It's dancing.

KRAMER
No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally.

ELAINE
I dance fine.

KRAMER
You stink. (He exits)

ELAINE
He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?

JERRY
I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)

ELAINE
Jerry, do I stink?

JERRY
All right, you're beyond stink.

ELAINE
But I really enjoy dancing.

JERRY
And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.

ELAINE
It's that bad?

JERRY
Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.
(Elaine sees video camera)
% Elaine and Anna sitting in Elaine's office.

VOICE
I have George Costanza still holding.

ELAINE
George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.

GEORGE
Yo, Anna.

ANNA
Hi, George. What're you up to?

GEORGE
(Ironing) You don't wanna know.

ELAINE
Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.

GEORGE
What're you talkin' about?

ELAINE
Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.

GEORGE
Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!

ELAINE
I never should have given Anna the impression--

GEORGE
Pick it up, pick it up!

ELAINE
--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.

GEORGE
Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)

ELAINE
What?

GEORGE
You are ruinin' everything.

ELAINE
I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a
difficult seed.

ELAINE
George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?

ANNA
Um, no, I don't think so.

ELAINE
No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.

GEORGE
I'm a bad man!
% Jerry and Kramer exit the theater and see Brody.

BRODY
So where's the tape?

JERRY
No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.

BRODY
I need the tape.

JERRY
You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.

BRODY
Are you out of your mind?

JERRY
Kramer...

KRAMER
I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh,
Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him
happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.

BRODY
Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street!

JERRY
All right. That's it, I can't work like this.

KRAMER
Jerry...

JERRY
I'm off the project. (He exits)

KRAMER
Jerry!

BRODY
I want the tape.

KRAMER
Yeah.
% Jerry and George at Monk's.

GEORGE
Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?

JERRY
They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.

GEORGE
Anna actually has respect for me now. It's all over.

JERRY
Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing
is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)

KRAMER
Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!

JERRY
Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...

GEORGE
Did you say dangerous?
% Anna and George in George's car.

GEORGE
I'm a bootlegger.

ANNA
You're a what?

GEORGE
I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!

ANNA
Isn't that illegal?

GEORGE
I can do hard time for this one. And community service!

ANNA
Is this your FiberCon?

GEORGE
(Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!
% Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.

KRAMER
Jerry, George got arrested.

JERRY
What?

KRAMER
Yeah. He went at the Beekman, he tried to land, but they cheesed him.

JERRY
Oh now I see. (Buzzer) Yeah.

BRODY
Brody, I'm comin' up.

JERRY
What're we gonna do?

KRAMER
Well, I gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?

JERRY
I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!

KRAMER
Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)

BRODY
Where's the tape?

JERRY
Uh, well. It, uh...

BRODY
Is that it?

KRAMER
Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.

BRODY
How'd it turn out?

KRAMER + JERRY
Uh... great.

KRAMER
Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.

JERRY
Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.

KRAMER
Yeah, it's a disturbing image.

JERRY
Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancer, you cry again.
% Police station, Anna and George sitting down.

ANNA
(George is crying) It's all right, George. You'll just pay a fine and
that'll be it.

GEORGE
Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters)

ELAINE
Anna...

ANNA
Oh, Elaine, thanks for picking me up. I can explain everything.

ELAINE
All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza
enters)

FRANK
Okay, where's my boy?

GEORGE
Oh my God.

FRANK
I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger? (He hits George in the head)

GEORGE
Ow! Dad...

FRANK
Who put you up to this, was it her?

ELAINE
All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.

FRANK
My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.

ELAINE
You got that right.

FRANK
What the hell does that mean?

ELAINE
It means whatever the hell you want it to mean.

FRANK
You sayin' you want a piece of me?

ELAINE
I could drop you like a bag of dirt.

FRANK
You wanna piece of me? You got it! (They begin to fight)
% Jerry and Elaine walking down the street.

JERRY
But he's an old man, Elaine.

ELAINE
Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.

JERRY
(Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.

ELAINE
Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.

JERRY
No you don't.

MAN
You shot Death Blow?

JERRY
Yeah.

MAN
That was brilliant.

JERRY
Thank you. (They continue walking)

ELAINE
You were big.

JERRY
I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the
office? Back to normal?

ELAINE
Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.

JERRY
I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)

Elaine at the doctor's

ATTENDANT
The doctor will be with you in a moment.
Elaine looking at her chart

ELAINE
Difficult?

DOCTOR
Elaine. You shouldn't be reading that. So tell me about this rash
of yours.

ELAINE
Well it's , it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my
chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I
remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown
on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I
wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.

DOCTOR
Well that was a long time ago. How about if I just erase it. Now
about that rash......

ELAINE
But it was in pen. You fake erase.

DOCTOR
All right Miss Benes. This doesn't look to serious. You'll be fine

ELAINE
What are you writing? Doctor.

JERRY
What are you doing?

GEORGE
I meet this women , Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo

JERRY
Extra teeth. I love that look.

GEORGE
Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says " I
hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."

JERRY
What mustard stain?

GEORGE
Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures.

JERRY
Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?

GEORGE
That's got nothing to do with it.

JERRY
I see. She's looking.

GEORGE
Yesssss.

KRAMER
Hey , you got to get this thing fixed.

JERRY
They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same.

Would you be interested?

JERRY
Well how are you going.....

KRAMER
Would you?

KRAMER
Yeah , yeah.
Elaine walks in

ELAINE
You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors
office today.

JERRY
Not the gown again.

ELAINE
No , no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why
would they write that?

JERRY
They have gotten to know you.
Kramer leaves with Jerry's stereo

ELAINE
Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my
rash.

GEORGE
Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.

ELAINE
Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.

JERRY
Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.

ELAINE
Listen to me you little shi........

GEORGE
Smile.
Elaine at another doctor's office

DOCTOR
Well Elaine you really didn't have to put on the gown.

ELAINE
Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's
perfect when you just want to throw something on.
Nurse hands the doctor her chart

DOCTOR
All rightly. Let me just review your history before we begin.

ELAINE
Where did you get my chart?

DOCTOR
From your last doctor. It's a standard procedure.

ELAINE
You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......

DOCTOR
Okay. Let's take a look. Well that doesn't look to serious. You'll
be fine.

What do you think it's a bomb?

JERRY
It's not totally impossible.

GEORGE
Oh the ego on you.

JERRY
Why can't I be bombable?

GEORGE
Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut
jokes.

JERRY
I suppose you think your bombable.

GEORGE
Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of
the way.

JERRY
There's more than a couple.

GEORGE
Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must
have loved these.

JERRY
You don't have a Mercedes.

GEORGE
I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was

GEORGE
What game?

KRAMER
She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is "
Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me
please. "

GEORGE
No good?

KRAMER
George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the
dance. She sends you an enticing photo , you send her one right back.

GEORGE
Oh , I don't know.

KRAMER
Well as you know I've always been something of a photog.

JERRY
Oh yeah I like this idea.

Kramer at doctor's

KRAMER
I like what you've done with that.

ATTENDANT
May I help you?

KRAMER
Yes , yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes
chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very
bad very messy.

ATTENDANT
I see and what clinic is that again?

KRAMER
That's correct.

ATTENDANT
Excuse me.

KRAMER
From The Hoffer-Mandale Clinic in Belgium.

ATTENDANT
Really?

KRAMER
The Netherlands?

ELAINE
Where's my chart? Did you get it?

KRAMER
No.

ELAINE
What? What happened?

KRAMER
I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.
George at photo store

SHEILA
I don't know where they could be.

GEORGE
Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues.

SHEILA
Well if I find them I'll call you.

GEORGE
And maybe we could go out and do something.

SHEILA
Sure.

RON
Hello.

GEORGE
Hi.
George leaves

SHEILA
So the little guy finally asked me out.

RON
Really?

SHEILA
Hey I can't find his photo's anywhere.

RON
Oh you know what happened. Some guy from the Post Office confiscated
them. He left his card.

SHEILA
Newman?
George and Jerry at Post Office

GEORGE
I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.
Newman ; Gentlemen , gentlemen. I am so happy to see you both. There is just
some inconsistencies I'd like to straighten out.

JERRY
I'm clean and you know it.

NEWMAN
Clean? Hardly. This looks like a man that isn't happy with his
stereo performance.

JERRY
Where did you get that?

GEORGE
I think that's one of mine.

NEWMAN
It looks like your breaking into it like an otter breaking into a clam.

JERRY
I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.

NEWMAN
Yes. It's called mail fraud. Oohhhh. How I've longed for this
moment Seinfeld. The day when I would have the proof I needed to hall you out
of your cushy lair and expose to the light of justice as the monster that you
are. A monster so vile.....

GUY
NEWMAN!!

NEWMAN
There will be a small fine.

JERRY
Okay.

GEORGE
Can we go now?

NEWMAN
Not so fast pretty boy. There is more to this sorted little affair.

JERRY
Oh my god!!

NEWMAN
This photo clearly indicates your involvement in some ill-conceived
mail order pornography ring.As does this one found in the same disturbing
packet.
Newman holds up a picture of Ron

GEORGE
OH MY GOD!!!

NEWMAN
We have some questions we'd like you to answer.

JERRY
I have some questions of my own.
Sheila walks in

SHEILA
Hi. One of your mailmen....... Oh my god , George!?!

GEORGE
Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong
person. He said the key word was tasteful.

JERRY
The timeless art of seduction.

GEORGE
SHEILA!!!
End.
First scene.
Jerry and a woman are eating at a restaurant.

WOMAN
Well I started out working in mortgage bonds, but I just found that so
limiting.

JERRY
My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. 
He was with Brant-Leland for a while.

WOMAN
Wow. Well then my mentor suggested that I move into equities, best move
I ever made.

JERRY
Mentor? You mean your boss.

WOMAN
Oh, no no no, Cynthia's just a successful businesswoman who's taken me
under her wing.

JERRY
Hmm. So Cynthia's your mentor.

WOMAN
And I'm her protg. You must have someone like that. You know, who
guides you in your career path.

JERRY
Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.
New scene.
George and Jerry are in Jerry's apartment.

GEORGE
I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?

JERRY
Yes. And the mentor advises the protg.

GEORGE
Is there any money involved?

JERRY
No.

GEORGE
So what's in it for the mentor?

JERRY
Respect, admiration, prestige.

GEORGE
Pssh. Would the protg pick up stuff for the mentor?

JERRY
I suppose if it was on the protg's way to the mentor, they might.

GEORGE
Laundry? Dry cleaning?

JERRY
It's not a valet, it's a protg.

GEORGE
Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this
here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.

JERRY (CHECKING OUT GEORGE'S TEXTBOOK)
Risk management?

GEORGE
Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a
lecture in their area of business expertise.

JERRY
Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?

GEORGE
I guess it's on my resume.
The phone rings, Jerry answers.

JERRY
Hello?

VOICE
Please hold for Elaine Benes.

GEORGE
You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on
tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. 
I hate my voice.

JERRY
So get this book on tape.

GEORGE
You can't, it's a textbook.

ELAINE
Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?

JERRY
Am I going? It was three nights ago.

ELAINE
What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so
excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.

JERRY
Oh, it was a lovely affair.

ELAINE
Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all
the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?

JEANINE
Eddie Sherman.

ELAINE
Alright, send him up here.

JERRY
You gonna do a little yelling?

ELAINE
I'm gonna do a little firing.

JERRY
That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?

ELAINE
Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break.
Jerry gets a dial tone and hangs up; he looks over at George who has nodded off
with the book in his lap. Jerry picks up a peanut and tosses it at George,
hitting him in the glasses and waking him up.

JERRY
Hey, Copernicus?
New scene.
Elaine's office.

JEANINE
Eddie Sherman is here.

ELAINE
Oh, great. Send him in.
Eddie Sherman walks in dressed in full military fatigues. He speaks in a raspy
voice.

EDDIE
You wanted to see me?

ELAINE
Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to...
promote you.
New scene.
Elaine and Jerry are at the coffee shop.

JERRY
So, what did you say?

ELAINE
Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him
something important. So I promoted him.

JERRY
What? What did you--

ELAINE
Copywriter.

JERRY
He's writing copy?

ELAINE
Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn
out.
Kramer walks in carrying a stack of flyers, he hands a few to Jerry and Elaine.

KRAMER
Yowza yowza. Check it out.

JERRY (READING)
Jewish singles night?

KRAMER
I expect you both to be there.

ELAINE
I'm not Jewish.

KRAMER
Well neither am I.

JERRY
Well why are you going?

KRAMER
I'm not, I'm running it.

JERRY
What are you talking about?

KRAMER
Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.

JERRY
Lomez is Jewish?

KRAMER
Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.

ELAINE (READING)
At the Knights of Columbus?

KRAMER
Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry,
you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.

JERRY
Kramer, you know, I--

KRAMER
No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.

ELAINE (READING)
A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.

KRAMER
Do you like tsimmis?
New scene.
Jerry and Abby are being seated in a restaurant.

ABBY
My mentor says the duck is outstanding here.

JERRY
I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.

ABBY
Oh! Look who's here, Cynthia!

CYNTHIA
Hello, Abby.

ABBY
Hello. Jerry, this is Cynthia Pearlman, my mentor.

JERRY
Hello.

CYNTHIA
Hi Jerry, nice to finally meet you.

ABBY
Well come join us, we could pull up a chair.

CYNTHIA
Great, my boyfriend's just parking the car. Actually, Jerry, you
night know him, he's a comic too.

JERRY
No kidding?

CYNTHIA
Kenny Banya.

JERRY
Banya?
Banya enters.

BANYA
Hey, Jerry!! How's it going?! You gonna join us for dinner? The duck
here's the best. The best, Jerry.
New scene.
George is on the subway, seated beside a blind man wearing headphones.

GEORGE
Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook
on tape. May I ask where you got that?

MAN
Reading for the Blind. They can get any book on tape.

GEORGE
I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.

MAN
Oh, tell me about it. These things have ruined me for Braille.
New scene.
George and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.

JERRY
Reading for the Blind?

GEORGE
I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging
to the sweet sounds of risk management.

JERRY
So, I finally met the mentor.

GEORGE
What's she like? Impressive?

JERRY
Oh yeah, she's dating Banya.

GEORGE
Banya?

JERRY
Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.

GEORGE
What did you have?

JERRY
Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time
with Banya?

GEORGE
Marsala?

JERRY
Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Banya should be
setting pins in a bowling alley.

GEORGE (LEAVING)
Alright, I got a test to fail.

JERRY
Hey, good luck with that.

GEORGE
Thank you.
George opens the door to see Kramer and Frank leaving Kramer's apartment.

GEORGE
Dad.

FRANK
What are you wearing, an athletic sweat suit?

GEORGE
What are you doing here?

KRAMER
Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I
got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.

JERRY
Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and
eighty-three people?

KRAMER
Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know
anybody who can help me cook?

FRANK
Cook? No, I don't know any cooks. I don't know anything about cooking!
Frank storms out of the apartment.

KRAMER
What's the matter with him?

GEORGE
My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened,
ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.

KRAMER
Shell-shocked?

GEORGE
Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.
New scene.
Elaine is wrapping up a meeting at Peterman's.

ELAINE
That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.

EDDIE
Wait. You didn't ask me about my ideas.

ELAINE
Oh, Eddie, well it's your first day.

EDDIE
I'm ready.

ELAINE
Oh, okay.

EDDIE (READING)
It's a hot night. The mind races. You think about your
knife; the only friend who hasn't betrayed you, the only friend who won't be
dead by sun up. Sleep tight, mates, in your quilted Chambray nightshirts.
New scene.
Elaine and Jerry are at the coffee shop.

ELAINE
What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.

JERRY
Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.

ELAINE
You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I
should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can
sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.
New scene.
George is taking an eye exam.

GEORGE
Nothing at all.

DOCTOR
Well George, your vision is quite impaired. If you'll just sign this
insurance form, here's a pen.
George reaches for the pen and grabs the Doctor's face.

GEORGE
You're a very handsome man, by the way.
New scene.
Jerry walks into his apartment; there are pots and pans bubbling on the stove.

JERRY
What the hell is going on here?
Kramer comes running in holding a scalding pot full of dumplings, he drops the
pot into the sink and cools his burnt fingers.

JERRY
What are you doing?

KRAMER
I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got
kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.

JERRY
No, I don't want to.

KRAMER
Eat, eat! You're skin and bones.
Jerry gabs a fork and tastes a piece.

KRAMER
Hah?

JERRY
Oh, this is awful.

KRAMER
Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.
Kramer bites into one and spits it out.

JERRY
Did you follow the recipe?

KRAMER
The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred
and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.

JERRY
It tastes like dirt.

KRAMER
Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no
skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no
sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.

JERRY
Kramer, you can't talk to Frank.

KRAMER
No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.
Abby walks in.

ABBY
I think there's a dead animal in the elevator.

KRAMER
My stuffed cabbage!
Kramer runs out.

ABBY
So, great dinner last night.

JERRY
Yeah, it was alright.

ABBY
I told Cynthia we'd double with her and Banya Saturday and then catch his
act.

JERRY
No. No, no way, no Banya.

ABBY
What?

JERRY
Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. 
He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.

ABBY
Cynthia would not date a hack.

JERRY
Would. Does. Is.
New scene.
Elaine is chairing a meeting at Peterman's.

ELAINE
Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no
longer writing for this catalog.
There are general remarks of relief from the meeting attendees.

ELAINE
He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.

EMPLOYEE
You promoted him?

ELAINE
Well, no, I would hardly--

EMPLOYEE
I bust my hump ever day.

ELAINE
Relax--

EMPLOYEE
As far as I'm concerned, you and your deranged protg can run the
catalog by yourselves! I quit!
What follows is a chorus of "me too"s and "I'm with him"s as everybody walks
out.

ELAINE
Well, hey? Hey. Hey!!
New scene.
George is in his office at Yankee stadium, he pushes 'play' on a cassette
recorder. The voice on the tape sounds exactly like George.

VOICE
Chapter one. In order to manage risk we must first understand risk. 
How do you spot risk? How do you avoid risk and what makes it so risky?

GEORGE
This guy sounds just like me.

VOICE
To understand risk, we must first define risk.

GEORGE
This is horrible.

VOICE
Risk is defined as--

GEORGE (BANGING THE RECORDER)
Stop it! Stop it!
New scene.
Kramer is at Frank's.

KRAMER
C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.

FRANK
In my mind, there's a war still going on.

KRAMER
Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?
Frank pours a shot of whiskey and drinks it.

FRANK
Inchon, Korea, 1950. I was the best cook Uncle Sam ever saw, slinging
hash for the Fighting 103rd. As we marched north, our supply lines were getting
thin. One day a couple of GIs found a crate, inside were six hundred pounds of
prime Texas steer. At least it once was prime. The Use date was three weeks
past, but I was arrogant, I was brash, I thought if I used just the right
spices, cooked it long enough...

KRAMER
What happened?

FRANK
I went too far. I over seasoned it. Men were keeling over all around
me. I can still hear the retching, the screaming. I sent sixteen of my own men
to the latrines that night. They were just boys.

KRAMER
Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for
everyone.

FRANK
Tell that to Bobby Colby. All that kid wanted to do was go home. Well
he went home alright, with a crater in his colon the size of a cutlet. Had to
sit him on a cork the eighteen-hour flight home!

KRAMER
Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is
your chance to make it all right again.

FRANK
No. No, I'll never cook again! Never! Now get out of my house!! Get
out. Go.
New scene.
Jerry and Abby are in Jerry's apartment.

JERRY
So you saw Banya's act?

ABBY
He got two minutes into that Ovaltine thing and I just couldn't take it
anymore.

JERRY
I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.

ABBY
Why is he so obsessed with Ovaltine?

JERRY
He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.

ABBY
Anyway, Cynthia and I got into this big argument afterwards and I think
it's over.

JERRY
No more mentor?

ABBY
Looks that way.

JERRY
Well at least you and I are okay again.

ABBY
Actually I was kind of thinking that maybe we shouldn't see each other
for a while.

JERRY
Why?

ABBY
Well I'm feeling a little disoriented. It's just weird for me not to
have an advisor.

JERRY
I can tell you what to do.

ABBY
No, it's more than that.

JERRY
I can tell you what to think.

ABBY
I need someone I can trust.

JERRY
Oh.
George busts in.

GEORGE
I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.

JERRY
Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
George shuts up and relaxes on the couch.

JERRY
George?

ABBY
I gotta run anyway.

JERRY
I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.

ABBY
I just need someone who can give me some kind of direction. I'll see ya.

JERRY
Yeah, see ya.
Abby leaves and George gets up and runs out the door after her.

JERRY
What's your problem.
George runs back.

GEORGE
No problem.
George runs away again.
New scene.
Elaine and Eddie Sherman are alone in the office working on writing copy.

EDDIE
Hey, I think I got something here. The Bengalese Galoshes.

ELAINE
Oh.

EDDIE (READING)
It's tough keeping your feet dry when you're kicking in a
skull.

ELAINE
You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.

EDDIE
Well, I'm not married to it.
Elaine. Oh. Well, um, in that case why don't we take the phrase, "kicking in a
skull" and we tweak it, you know, just a hair, to something like, what, like
"strolling through a dewy meadow"?

EDDIE
Dewy meadow.
New scene.
Frank and Estelle are in their kitchen.

ESTELLE
Here's your omelet.

FRANK
It's dry.

ESTELLE
That's the way I always make it.

FRANK
Well it sucks.

ESTELLE
What did you say?

FRANK
Your meatloaf is mushy, your salmon croquettes are oily and your
eggplant parmesan is a disgrace to this house!

ESTELLE
Well that's too bad, because I'm the only one who cooks around here!

FRANK
Not any more! Gimme that spatula! I'm back, baby!
New scene.
George and Abby are at George's office.

ABBY
And you're sure with your busy schedule you'd have time to take on a
protg?

GEORGE
I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I
didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.

ABBY
I'm not familiar with that, you'll have to explain it to me.

GEORGE
I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if
you can explain it to me.

ABBY
Alright.

GEORGE
Okay.
New scene.
Jerry runs into Banya on a street corner.

BANYA
Hey Jerry.

JERRY
Oh, hey Banya.

BANYA
Didja hear what happened? The mentor saw my act. She dumped me.

JERRY
Oh, that's too bad.

BANYA
Maybe she's right. Maybe I am a complete hack. I'm the absolute worst. 
The worst, Jerry.

JERRY
Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that
Bosco bit then you got your Nestl's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--

BANYA
You think you can give me a hand with my material?
New scene.
Frank is knocking on Kramer's door.

KRAMER
Hey.

FRANK
You still need a cook?

KRAMER
Oh yeah, come on in, Frank.

FRANK
Ya got T-Fal?

KRAMER
Keflon.

FRANK
No! Follow me.

Jerry is reviewing material with Banya.

BANYA (READING)
Why do they call it Ovaltine? The mug is round. The jar is
round. They should call it round tine. That's gold, Jerry! Gold!

Elaine is reviewing copy with Eddie.

ELAINE
Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel" and "scar tissue" with "string of
pearls" and "raspberry scones".
New scene.
Jerry and Abby are at Jerry's apartment.

JERRY
George Costanza is your mentor?

ABBY
Yeah, he's great! I am learning so much.
Abby places her risk management folder on the table.

JERRY
About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?

ABBY
You know what your problem is? You just have no respect for the
mentor/mentor relationship.

JERRY
As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own.
Jerry places his Banya folder on the table.

ABBY
Who?

JERRY
A Mister Kenneth Banya.

ABBY
Banya?

JERRY
I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.

ABBY
Huh, well, I don't think I want to date a mentor whose protg is a hack.
Abby picks up a folder and puts it in her bag.

JERRY
Well, I don't think I want to date a protg whose mentor is a Costanza.
New scene.
Elaine and Eddie are sharing chocolate shakes at the coffee shop.

ELAINE
I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between
us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.

EDDIE
Cool.

ELAINE
Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the
psychotic imagery? Huh?

EDDIE
I don't want to talk about it.

ELAINE
Come on, don't be a baby.

EDDIE
I went out on a couple of dates with this woman, I thought she really
liked me, and then things kind of cooled off.

ELAINE
That's it?

EDDIE
Well it's tough meeting somebody you like, let alone somebody Jewish.

ELAINE
Mm. This food is fantastic.

JERRY
Have you tried the hamentashen?

ELAINE
I can't get off the kishkas.

BANYA
Hey Jerry!

Banya?

BANYA
I just stopped by to thank you. That risk management stuff you wrote
for me? It's killer!

JERRY
Risk management?

BANYA
Aw, it's gold, Jerry! Gold! I got all these corporate gigs and even
Cynthia took me back.
Cut to a woman talking with Eddie Sherman.

WOMAN
So you went from the mailroom to the director of corporate development
in two days?

EDDIE
That's right.

WOMAN
How much are they paying you? I'll double it.
Cut to Kramer and Frank behind a table loaded with 'Jewish delicacies'.

KRAMER
Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.

FRANK
Where's the powdered sugar?

KRAMER
You know Frank, you could take a break.

FRANK
No breaks. I fell reborn, I'm like a Phoenix rising from Arizona.
Cut to Eddie breaking the news to Elaine.

ELAINE
You're quitting?

EDDIE
I can't churn out that pointless drivel any more.

ELAINE
Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!
Elaine grabs Eddie by the lapels and shakes him, Eddie chokes on a piece of
bread. Frank sees this and flashes back to Korea. He runs around the room
knocking plates to the floor and when Kramer tries to stop him, he heads to the
loaded down table and starts to tip it over. The scene ends in mid-tip.

George is prepared to give his speech at the Yankees meeting.

Our next speaker is George Costanza on the subject of risk management.
George steps up and opens his folder.

GEORGE
Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
George flips through a few pages.

GEORGE
They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.

WILHELM (PROUDLY, TO THE MAN SEATED BESIDE HIM)
He's my protg.

Noooo!!! Don't eat it! No good!"

Jerry and Elaine come out of a drugstore. Elaine has a couple of carrier bags
she's fussing with the contents of.

JERRY
Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs?
Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.

ELAINE
Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.

JERRY
Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get
sick?
Jerry and Elaine begin to walk along the street.

ELAINE
What is this, a 'bit'?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
'Cos I'm not in the mood.

JERRY
We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If
you feel good, you're supposed to take one!

ELAINE
Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.

JERRY
They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.

ELAINE
(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?

JERRY
(hopeful) Then you admit it was amusing?

ELAINE
It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and
hit the word 'good' harder.

JERRY
(thinking) Great. Thanks.
[Some Fancy Place]
The room is stylishly furnished. A number of people sit around, chatting and
drinking. Elaine and her new boyfriend, Brett, walk across the room, carrying
drinks.

ELAINE
So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?

BRETT
We manufacture it. The original designs are by Karl Farbman.
Elaine and Brett sit on a couch

ELAINE
(as if she knows) Oh, Farbman.

BRETT
You know Farbman?

ELAINE
Mm, love Farbman.   

BRETT
Most people go their whole lives without sitting in a Farbman.

ELAINE
Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.
Music begins to play. It's The Eagles' Desperado. Brett hears the music and
is enraptured. He stares off into the distance, oblivious to everything but
the song.

ELAINE
Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
Brett hasn't heard a word of what Elaine said, continuing to stare off into
the distance.

ELAINE
Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
Brett still doesn't react.

ELAINE
Brett?

BRETT
(still staring off) After the song, babe.

ELAINE
Huh?

BRETT
The song.
Elaine stares at Brett and puts a hand to her chest, moved by his
sensitivity.
[Street]
Jerry and Elaine come round the corner, past the Chinese restaurant and walk
along the street.

JERRY
So when do I meet this jerk?

ELAINE
He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.

JERRY
Who?

ELAINE
(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous,
and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.

JERRY
What song?

ELAINE
Desperado.

JERRY
Desperado?

ELAINE
Uh huh.

JERRY
And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
Ahead of the strolling twosome, a guy stands on the sidewalk, twirling a
brightly-coloured umbrella over his shoulder.

JERRY
(pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.

ELAINE
Uh huh.

JERRY
I invented that.

ELAINE
That, had to be invented?

JERRY
When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to
twirl it, to attract customers.
Elaine folds her arms, unconvinced.

ELAINE
(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?
Elaine marches toward the umbrella guy.

JERRY
Elaine.

ELAINE
Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he
invented that little twirl you're doing.

JERRY
Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history
lesson.

CLICKY
Teddy Padillac came up with this twirl.

ELAINE
(looking at Jerry) Ohh.

JERRY
I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.

CLICKY
Yeah, that's where he come up with it.

JERRY
In his dreams.

ELAINE
Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?
Elaine walks off, crossing the street. Jerry follows.

JERRY
(to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the
customers.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is demonstrating twirling an umbrella to George, who sits in a chair
with a magazine.

JERRY
It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.

GEORGE
(pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway?
Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.

JERRY
(as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.
Jerry tosses his umbrella onto the couch, and walks toward the kitchen. The
door opens and Kramer enters, carrying a large envelope.

KRAMER
Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you.
Ker-ching.

JERRY
(taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster
than I can sign 'em.

GEORGE
What checks?

KRAMER
Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.

JERRY
I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening
credits of some Japanese comedy show.

KRAMER
Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour.

JERRY
(opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it
all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.

GEORGE
Look at all of those! You're rich!

JERRY
Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in
my hand to sign 'em.
Kramer sits on the couch and flinches as he sits on the umbrella. He reaches
under himself and extracts it, then jumps again as he accidentally opens it.
He gets back up, and heads to the kitchen.

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?

JERRY
Why?

KRAMER
(getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's
new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's
a Farbman.
George wanders over.

GEORGE
He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?

JERRY
Ah, who are any of her losers?

GEORGE
(dryly) You're on that list.
George goes and gets his coat.

GEORGE
Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet
cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.

KRAMER
Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?

EGO
Yeah, you heard of 'em?

KRAMER
They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means
for them to get into your apartment.

GEORGE
So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless
blather.

JERRY
I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
[Street]
Kramer and Jerry stroll along. Jerry is massaging his left hand, as if it's
giving him discomfort.

JERRY
Signed over a hundred checks this morning.

KRAMER
Hello, twelve dollars.
Jerry and Kramer draw level with three Japanese tourists. One of them steps
forward, holding out a camera.

MR OH
Excuse me. Would you take picture please?

KRAMER
(takes camera) Oh, yeah, sure.
Jerry has spotted something further along the street. It's another umbrella
salesman, twirling his wares.

JERRY
I'm gonna ask this guy something.
Jerry walks along to the guy. Kramer fusses about, taking a picture of the
three Japanese guys, at one point he steps back to frame them all, and
stumbles off the curb.

JERRY
(to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented
that, don't you?
Back down the street, Kramer has finished photographing. He looks over toward
Jerry, and thinks for a second.

KRAMER
(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.

MR YAMAGUCHI
Hai.

MR OH
Yes.

KRAMER
(points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?
Jerry has taken one of the umbrellas, and is demonstrating the twirl to the
guy. He's speaking animatedly, with lots of hand gestures and arm waving.

KRAMER
That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super
Terrific Happy Hour.

MR OH
Ahh, Super Terrific Happy...
The three guys all speak to each other in excited Japanese.

KRAMER
Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him.
Kramer and the three guys look along to where Jerry is still talking
vigorously to the umbrella guy.

MR OH
What is he doing?

KRAMER
Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.

MR OH
He's funny.

KRAMER
Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his
antics.
Jerry is tossing the umbrella from hand to hand, with the unimpressed guy
watching him. Kramer laughs, and the Japanese all join in.

KRAMER
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in
America.
Kramer and the Japanese all laugh uproariously, watching Jerry.
[George's Apartment]
Three guys in bright yellow overalls stand in George's living room. Two of
them have a large carpet cleaner by the door, ready to leave, The third, the
leader, has a notebook.

CREW LEADER
(calling to George) We're pretty much finished.
George enters from another room.

CREW LEADER
There's just one more thing.

GEORGE
(smiling expectantly) Here it comes.
The leader opens his book and holds up a check.

CREW LEADER
(clears throat) You forgot to sign your check.
The leader hands George a pen, and waits as George appends his signature.

GEORGE
(signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything
else?

CREW LEADER
(flat) No.
The carpet cleaners begin to leave. George follows the leader toward the
door, looking disappointed.

GEORGE
(let down) So, that's it?

CREW LEADER
Unless you need a receipt.

GEORGE
(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing.
I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.

CREW LEADER
(flat) Good luck with that.
The leader closes the door on a perplexed George.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry sits at his table. He's signing checks, and holding his pen awkwardly
in his hand which is twisted uncomfortably. Elaine enters and notices his
hand.

JERRY
Hey.

ELAINE
What's with the claw?

JERRY
Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.
Elaine wanders toward the kitchen. The door opens and Brett enters.

BRETT
(to Elaine) There's no sign of Kramer.

ELAINE
Oh, Brett. (indicating) This is Jerry.

JERRY
Hi.
Jerry holds up his twisted hand in greeting. Brett copies the position of the
fingers in his wave back.

BRETT
That's very funny. Elaine told me you were some kinda comedian.

JERRY
Ah, I'm one kind.
Elaine gets a bottle of water form the fridge.

ELAINE
Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?

JERRY
The Fleckman.

BRETT
Farbman.

JERRY
Right.

ELAINE
You gotta see 'em. Beautiful.

JERRY
(not interested) Oh, I'm sure they are.

BRETT
I'd be happy to get you some if that's what you're driving at.

JERRY
No. I'm fine, thank you.

BRETT
Don't worry. It's no charge to you.
Brett walks over past Jerry and points to Jerry's desk.

BRETT
Looks like what you really need is a decent desk for writing your
skits.

JERRY
(quiet annoyance) I don't write skits.

BRETT
(walking back to Elaine) Well, of course you don't. You don't have a
proper workstation. I'll fax you over my catalogue.

ELAINE
Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.

BRETT
(quiet) Oops.
Brett looks round at Jerry, seeming embarrassed.

BRETT
Well, I'm sure things'll pick up for you soon. Elaine, maybe we should
get going.
Brett opens the door.

ELAINE
Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?

JERRY
Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?

BRETT
(scoff) Coffee shop? I think we can do a little better than that. You
look like you could use a solid meal at a real restaurant.

JERRY
You look like you could use a...

ELAINE
(warning) Jerry.
[Saks]
Kramer and the Japanese tourists are looking at stuff. Kramer picks up a
Stetson and reads the price tag.

KRAMER
(reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run
you in Tokyo?
Kramer holds the hat over, so Mr Oh can get a look.

MR OH
(thinks for a second) Ahh, about, uh, thirty thousand yen.

KRAMER
(shocked) Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.
Kramer places the hat on an unsure Mr Oh's head.

KRAMER
Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.
Kramer hands Stetsons to each of the other Japanese.
[Brett's Car]
Brett and Elaine sit in his parked two seat Ferrari.

BRETT
I feel terrible about your friend Jerry. He's upset that I gave Kramer
that chest of drawers, isn't he?

ELAINE
Why? Why d'you think he's upset?

BRETT
How could he not be? Living in that cramped little apartment. And
outdated furniture, so terribly... un-Karl Farbman-like.

ELAINE
(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?

BRETT
(smiling) I hope not.
Brett leans across to kiss Elaine. Just as they begin to kiss, the Eagles'
Desperado comes on the radio. Brett immediately breaks off the kiss, and
stares off into the distance again.

ELAINE
(surprised) Brett? Everything alright?
Brett makes no response.

ELAINE
(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?

BRETT
Elaine, the song.

ELAINE
(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought
it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on
the fender...

BRETT
Elaine, could you just not talk for one minute?

ELAINE
(apologetic, silently mouthed) Sorry.
Elaine stares queryingly at the rapt Brett.
[Monk's]
Jerry and George sit in a booth, sipping coffee.

JERRY
No spiel?

GEORGE
(annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call
themselves a cult!

JERRY
So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to
abduct you?

GEORGE
They could've at least tried!

JERRY
You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?

GEORGE
Please.

JERRY
Too dumb?
George gives Jerry a look. Kramer enters, wearing a snazzy new suit. He
strolls over to the booth.

JERRY
(impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.

KRAMER
Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside
Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the
Rainbow Room.

JERRY
Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.

KRAMER
Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi
you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money
goes, hmm?
Jerry looks puzzled.

KRAMER
That's right.

GEORGE
How'd you hook up with these guys?

KRAMER
Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See
now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.

JERRY
What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?

KRAMER
(to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.

GEORGE
(excited) Yeah, the pilot!

KRAMER
That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.

GEORGE
(enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV.
They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New
York!

JERRY
Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.

GEORGE
(animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a
TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about
their dates!
Jerry looks doubtful.

KRAMER
George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in
Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.
Jerry looks at George, wondering.
[Japanese TV Office]
Jerry and George sit on a couch. Two Japanese TV executives, one male, one
female, sit on chairs. They are all watching the pilot show Jerry made at the
end of Season 4. The Japanese are not looking impressed. George is smiling
and pointing, enthusiastically. On a coffee table sits a large bowl
containing a plastic bag of oranges.

TV JERRY
You had a date? You went out with my butler?! Who said you could go
out with my butler?!

TV ELAINE
Well, why do I need your permission?

TV JERRY
Because he's my butler.
The first executive stops the tape.

GEORGE
(eager) So? What d'you think?

EXECUTIVE 1
We're bit confused. Why was this man Jerry's butler?

GEORGE
Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car
accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge
decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.

EXECUTIVE 1
Is this customary in your legal system?

JERRY
No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.

EXECUTIVE 1
(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Are you following any of this?

EXECUTIVE 2
(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: I'm still trying to figure out why
they gave us a bag of oranges.

EXECUTIVE 1
(to Jerry and George) I'm sorry. I'm sure Mr Seinfeld is very
funny to Americans, but I'm not sure this butler show would work in Japan.

GEORGE
Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too
long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have
no oranges.
Jerry nods, sagely, and picks up a cup of coffee. His fingers are still
twisted from the check signing.

EXECUTIVE 1
(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Again with the oranges
There's a crash as Jerry's grip on the cup fails and he drops it.

JERRY
(flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.

GEORGE
(positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy
Hour. (laughs)

EXECUTIVE 1
You must go now.
Jerry pats George on the knee. George squeezes Jerry's shoulder and they
ruefully begin to depart.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry sits at his table, signing yet more checks, the pen gripped in his
clawed fingers. Elaine stands in her jacket, her bag on the table.

ELAINE
Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during
Desperado.

JERRY
(throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado
station?

ELAINE
He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm
sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.

JERRY
You know, what you need is a song you can share.

ELAINE
Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.

JERRY
Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
Elaine tips back her head and thinks for a second, before something occurs.

ELAINE
(points) I like Witchy Woman.

JERRY
Witchy Woman?

ELAINE
You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.

JERRY
(getting it) Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.
The door opens and Kramer enters, wearing his suit and carrying another fat
envelope.

KRAMER
(to Jerry) Hey, man.

ELAINE
Hey.
Kramer puts the envelope down on the table next to Jerry. Elaine walks to the
kitchen.

JERRY
Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?

KRAMER
Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight
monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.

JERRY
Ah.

KRAMER
Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?

JERRY
What for?
Kramer wanders into Jerry's bedroom.

KRAMER (O.C.)
Yeah, well, uh, my Japanese friends're gonna stay with me.

JERRY
I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
Kramer reenters, carrying three pillows.

KRAMER
Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you
do.

JERRY
Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?

KRAMER
Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with
fifty thousand yen.
Elaine is in the kitchen, eating cereal from the box.

ELAINE
Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?

KRAMER
Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of
drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.

ELAINE
In them?!

JERRY
You have them sleeping in drawers?!

KRAMER
Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in
tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.

JERRY
This has 'international incident' written all over it.

KRAMER
(smiling) Oh yeah, yeah.
[Kramer's Apartment]
Up against one wall of the apartment stands a very large chest of three
drawers. It's about six feet long and each drawers is maybe a foot and a half
deep. Kramer walks over to it and looks into the open top drawer.

KRAMER
Goodnight, Mr Tanaka.
One of the Japanese tourists sits up in the drawer.

MR TANAKA
Goodnight.
Mr Tanaka lies down again, and Kramer slides the drawer shut. He then speaks
to the occupant of the next drawer.

KRAMER
Goodnight, Mr Oh.

MR OH
(sits up) Goodnight.
Mr Oh lies back down and Kramer slides the drawers shut, and speaks to the
final drawer's occupant.

KRAMER
Goodnight, Mr Yamaguchi.

MR YAMAGUCHI
(sits up) Oh, yes. Goodnight.
Mr Yamaguchi lies down. Kramer shuts the final drawer, switches off the lamp
and, yawning, walks off toward his own bed
[Jerry's Apartment]
Kramer is in the kitchen. He has three bowls out on the counter, and a box of
Rice Crispies. Jerry walks over, pushing a bunch of checks into an envelope.

JERRY
What is this?

KRAMER
Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry.

JERRY
Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well,
I'm off to the bank.

KRAMER
(opening the fridge) Sayonara.

JERRY
(leaving) Konichi-wa.
Kramer fetches out milk and continues making breakfast.
[Brett's Car]
Elaine and Brett sit in the parked Ferrari. Witchy Woman is playing on the
stereo. Elaine is listening, with her eyes closed and her head nodding. Brett
looks puzzled.

BRETT
Elaine, I...

ELAINE
Shh-shh! (smiling) What d'you think?
Elaine continues to listen. Brett leans forward and switches off the music.

ELAINE
What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.

BRETT
Witchy Woman is okay for you, but I've already got a song.

ELAINE
Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it.

BRETT
(flat) No. It's mine.
There is a flash of lightning and thunder rolls. Elaine peers out at the
weather.
[Kramer's Apartment]
The top and bottom drawers are open in the chest. Mr Yamaguchi sits up in the
bottom drawer, and Mr Tanaka sits on top of the chest, with his feet in his
drawer. Kramer comes over and hands bowls of Rice Crispies to the pair of
them.

KRAMER
Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop.
Kramer leans over and raps on the face of the middle drawer.

KRAMER
(loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.

MR OH (O.C.)
Ach, come back in half hour.
Kramer looks impatient. He puts the bowl of Rice Crispies on top of the chest
and walks off mumbling irritably.
[Street]
It is pouring with rain. Jerry walks along the street, wearing just a light
jacket over his clothes. He still has the envelope in his hands. Jerry spots
the umbrella vendor, twirling his wares.

JERRY
(calls) Hey, I'll take one.

CLICKY
Well, look who's back!
Clicky turns to another umbrella seller,who is facing the other way.

CLICKY
Teddy! (indicates Jerry) This's the guy says he invented the twirl.

TEDDY
(unfriendly recognition) Jerry Seinfeld!

JERRY
Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've
you got in a push-button mini.

TEDDY
(bitter) Same thing we had, when you bailed on us, fifteen years ago.

JERRY
Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had
some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?

TEDDY
(angry) Oh, yeah, sure. But where were you during the poncho craze of
eighty-four? I almost lost my house.
A guy comes along the street, wearing one of Elaine's urban sombreros. Clicky
tries to catch his attention.

CLICKY
Umbrella, buddy?
The sombrero wearer waves away the attention and crosses the street.

CLICKY
Now we got that damn 'urban sombrero' to contend with.

TEDDY
(to Clicky) Easy, there. (to Jerry) I hear you're taking credit for
the twirl.

JERRY
Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?

TEDDY
(intense) I care. Clicky cares.

JERRY
So, could I...
Another peal of thunder rolls as interruption.

JERRY
Could I just buy an umbrella?

TEDDY
(sour) Yeah, sure. Two hundred dollars.

JERRY
(shock) What?!

TEDDY
(caustically) Special price, for a real foul-weather friend.
The rain continues to pour down unabated.
[George's Office, Yankee Stadium]
George is removing a tape from a VCR. Kramer enters, followed by the three
Japanese tourists. Outside the window, the rain can be seen bucketing down.

KRAMER
Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run
the bases.

GEORGE
(indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp
on the field.

KRAMER
(quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys?
Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.
George thinks for a minute, then looks down at the tape in his hands.

GEORGE
Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.

KRAMER
(snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how would
you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?
The Japanese nod to each other.

MR OH
But, we are also very hungry.

KRAMER
Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch the
tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.
Kramer and George wave the Japanese toward seats. Kramer leaves the office
and looks down the corridor. He raises his arm to attract attention.

KRAMER
(shouts) Hey, peanuts!
As the Japanese sit, Mr Wilhelm comes to the door.

WILHELM
George. (waves George over) George.
George goes out into the hall with Wilhelm.

WILHELM
(puzzled) Uh, George, uh, did you call some carpet cleaners?

GEORGE
Are they here?

WILHELM
They're in my office, right now.

GEORGE
(suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they?

WILHELM
About what?

GEORGE
(to himself, resentful) What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is
this?!
[Street]
Jerry walks along. He is still carrying the envelope of checks, and by now
he's drenched. A familiar red Ferrari pulls to a stop level with Jerry, and
the window winds down.

BRETT
(calls over) Hey Jerry!
Jerry peers at the car and walks out into the road as he recognises Brett.

JERRY
Oh, hi Brett.

BRETT
Haven't you ever heard of an umbrella?

JERRY
Ah, I didn't have enough money.

BRETT
I'm sure things'll pick up for you.

JERRY
No, it's not that, it's the...
Jerry looks down at the envelope of checks in his hands. The rain has soaked
them so thoroughly that the ink of his signatures has run and become
illegible.

JERRY
Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!
Brett peers over at the mass of sodden paper in Jerry's grip.

BRETT
Ah, don't worry, I can spot you the (reads) twelve cents?

JERRY
No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and
writing.

BRETT
Nothing's working for you, is is?

JERRY
(bitter) Not at the moment, Brett.

BRETT
I'd give you a ride, but I got Karl Farbman here.
Beside Brett sits a bald-headed, bearded, guy in shades.

JERRY
(sarcastic) Thanks for stopping!
Jerry walks away
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is drying the checks. Dozens hang from lines around the apartment, and
more sit on the table, where Jerry dabs them with a towel.

ELAINE
Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.

JERRY
Boogeyman.

ELAINE
Boogey?

JERRY
I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?

ELAINE
No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey,
what d'you think of Oye Como Va?

JERRY
(negative) Eehh.

ELAINE
(desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!
Elaine puts he hand to her head, walks round the room and flops onto the
couch. The door opens and George enters. He's in buoyant mood.

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
(excited) Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese
friends. They loved it!

JERRY
Really? They bought the butler character?

GEORGE
(excited) Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great
show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.

JERRY
NBC?

GEORGE
(little subdued) Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.
Elaine looks heavenwards.

JERRY
Ah. But they told us we must go now.

GEORGE
But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that
love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
George opens the door. Jerry comes over before he can leave.

JERRY
Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it
is. (vehement) Just take it!
George smiles, claps Jerry on the shoulder and leaves. Jerry starts to close
the door, but George turns back.

GEORGE
Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?

JERRY
Who?

GEORGE
The network executive. You think she liked me?
Jerry swings the door closed in George's face.
[Hallway]
George crosses the hall to Kramer's door. He knocks, but there is no
immediate reply. George listens, and can hear excited shouting and laughter.
He opens the door and goes in.
[Kramer's Apartment]
Kramer and the three Japanese sit in the hot-tub. They're stripped to the
waist (at least), wearing Stetsons, and drinking sake. They spot George as he
enters and shout greetings.

KRAMER
Heyy! Look who's here.
The Japanese whoop and wave at George.

KRAMER
(beckoning to George) Come on, I want you to come in here.
All the Japanese gesture and shout that George should get in the tub with
them.

MR OH
Come on in, fat boy!
George waves away their appeals with a smile.

GEORGE
Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. (thumbs up) Big day
tomorrow!
Kramer and the Japanese cheer and splash water at George, who leaves. Then
they go back to knocking back sake.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is re-signing all the checks he dried out.

JERRY
(to himself) Last one.
Jerry completes his signature and drops the pen from his claw-like hand. It's
clearly painful.

JERRY
(agonised) Uugh! Ahh.
[Street]
George stands outside the Nakahama Broadcast Corp offices. He's waiting for
someone. Kramer wanders up behind him and speaks into George's ear.

KRAMER
There you are.
George jumps, surprised by Kramer.

GEORGE
Uh. (smiles) Where's the boys?

KRAMER
Uh, no, I let 'em sleep in.
Kramer reaches into his pocket and pulls out a number of airline tickets.

KRAMER
I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a
little food money.

GEORGE
(horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes!

KRAMER
No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that
hot-tub.
A panicky George rushes toward a payphone.

GEORGE
(frantic) I'm calling Jerry.
[Street/Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is bathing his crippled left hand in a bowl of ice-water. The phone
rings and he picks up (with his right).

JERRY
Yeah?

GEORGE
(panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the
hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I
don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!

JERRY
(kidding) Uncle Leo?

GEORGE
(scream) Jerry!!
George begins hammering the phone against the kiosk. Jerry lifts the phone
away from his ear at the noise.

JERRY
Alright, alright. I'll wake 'em up.
Jerry hangs up the phone.

JERRY
(to himself) Hmm, testy.
[Kramer's Apartment]
The chest of drawers still stands against one wall. All the drawers are shut,
and from within them can be heard thumping noises and cries for help. Jerry
enters and hears the calls.

JERRY
Hello?

MR OH (O.C.)
Mr Jerry! Open the drawer, please!
Jerry pulls at the handle with his good hand, but it won't move. He tries to
hook his bad hand round the other handle and pull.

JERRY
It's stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the
wood.

MR OH (O.C.)
Pull harder.

JERRY
I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.

MR OH (O.C)
Very funny, but no joking, please.

JERRY
(looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out.
[Hallway]
Elaine and Brett stroll up to Jerry's door. Brett is carrying an umbrella.
Elaine looks dubious.

ELAINE
Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.

BRETT
Elaine, I know he'll appreciate this. Granted, it's not as nice as
Kramer's cabinet, but it's start.

ELAINE
Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.
Elaine reaches for Jerry's doorhandle, but a shout from Kramer's apartment
distracts her.

JERRY (O.C.)
(yell) Move to the back of the drawers!
Elaine moves to enter Kramer's apartment.

ELAINE
Jerry?
[Kramer's Apartment]
Elaine enters followed by Brett.

ELAINE
Jerry.
Jerry stands in front of the chest of drawers, holding a large fireman's axe.
He swings it high and smashes it into the top of the chest, the wood
splintering under the impact. Brett looks horrified. He drops the umbrella,
and rushes forward to protect the furniture.

BRETT
(shouting) Not the Farbman!!
Elaine stares after the charging Brett. She puts her hand to her mouth and
screams, horrified at what she sees.
[Japanese TV Office]
The Japanese tourists sit on the couch, looking like survivors of some
horrible ordeal, with the two executives in their chairs. George perches on
the arm of the couch.

MR OH
(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Jerry Seinfeld is a dangerous lunatic. He
wouldn't let us out of the drawers. Then he came at me with an axe.

EXECUTIVE 1
(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: We suspect his friend here is also
unbalanced.
The tourists turn slowly and look nervously at the smiling, uncomprehending,
George.

GEORGE
So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?

MR OH
(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: Could we have a couple of those oranges?
The executives gesture their assent. The tourists eagerly grab the fruit.

MR OH
(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: We are very hungry and have survived many
hardships.
Behind the couch, two of the carpet cleaner people enter, including the
leader. They walk over to a corner. George notices them and stands.

GEORGE
(to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet
Cleaners?

EXECUTIVE 1
Yes. Cleaned up the (points) coffee stain, left by Jerry
Seinfield.
Wilhelm enters, dressed in the same yellow overall as the other carpet
cleaners. George looks stunned.

GEORGE
Mr Wilhelm? Wha..what're you doing here?

WILHELM
I'm here to clean the carpets. Most of the world is carpeted. And,
one day, we will do the cleaning.
George lets this sink in, then slowly turns to the leader.

GEORGE
(incredulity) Him you brainwashed! (angry shout) What's he got that I
don't have?!
The leader shrugs, as if to say 'You work it out.'

GEORGE
(urgent) Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr
Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!

WILHELM
Wilhelm? (he raises the nozzle of his cleaner) My name is Tanya.
George purses his lips.

EXECUTIVE 1
(speaks Japanese) SUBTITLE: With these two idiots I don't know
how the Yankees won the World Series.
The second executive shakes her head.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Brett sits next to Jerry's table, looking dazed. Elaine stands beside him,
applying an icepack to his temple. Jerry stands opposite Eaine.

JERRY
(apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit
you in the head with.. an axe.
Elaine gives Jerry a look.

JERRY
(defensive) At least it was just the handle!

BRETT
It was a beautiful cabinet. What am I gonna tell...
Brett looks concerned.

BRETT
I can't remember his name!

JERRY
Fleckman?

ELAINE
Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds
Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'

ELAINE/JERRY
(singing) '...let somebody love you. Let somebody love you,
before it's too...'
Brett slips out from under the icepack and falls face-first onto the table
with an audible clunk. Elaine looks down, shocked. Jerry just looks down.
[Insert]
An ambulance races through the streets of New York, siren wailing.
[Emergency Room]
Brett lays on his back, as a doctor and nurse examine him.

NURSE
His pulse is fine.

DOCTOR
Hmm. Looks like a minor concussion. Let me see what I can do to
relieve the swelling.
Music begins to play. It's Witchy Woman, and the doctor gets the same look on
his face as Brett with Desperado. He looks off into the distance.

NURSE
Doctor?
The doctor stares away.

NURSE
(concerned) Doctor?
The doctor is oblivious to the nurse.

NURSE
(worried) Doctor?
There is still no response from the doctor.

NURSE
(alarm) Doctor, I think we're losing him!
As the doctor stares off into the distance, the monitoring instruments can be
heard beeping faster and faster.
End.
 George and Jerry are on the side of the street at a fruit stand

GEORGE
Why is there no haggling in this country?

JERRY
I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a
citrus drink.

GEORGE
Not me. Everything should be negotiable.

JERRY
Restaurants too?

GEORGE
Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta.
All starches are a scam.

JERRY
Yea especially ziti, with that big hole.
[George asks the store worker a question]

GEORGE
Excuse me, how much is this?

WORKER
Dollar nineteen.

GEORGE
I'll give you a quarter.

WORKER
Get the hell out of here.

JERRY
Tell him forty and no fork.

GEORGE
Thirty.

WORKER
That's it you leave and never come back!

JERRY
How about we leave and come back in a week?

WORKER
Deal!

GEORGE
Alright see? We got something there.
[Kramer and Jerry and on the side of the street talking about the new chicken
shack. ( I came in a little late.)]

JERRY
Look at the size of that neon light.

KRAMER
Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken places on
every block.

JERRY
He is the gambler.

KRAMER
Well, I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him pick out a
turtle.

JERRY
Try and stay calm.

KRAMER
Yea, yea.
[Exit the K-Man.]
[Man on street recognizes Jerry.]

MAN
Hey Jerry.

JERRY
Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?

SETH
At least.

JERRY
You wanna grab lunch?

SETH
Uh, I'm actually headed back to the office.

JERRY
Seth it's me. What's more important than catching up with an old
college buddy?

SETH
Well, I am supposed to be in this meeting.

JERRY
Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to?

SETH+JERRY
Alright, alright.

JERRY
Whatever happened to Moochie?

SETH
He's dead.

JERRY
Is that right?
[George and Elaine are in a store ]

GEORGE
I still don't understand how you can call lunch with me a business
expense.

ELAINE
What do you think of the catalog?

GEORGE
It stinks.

ELAINE
There, we just talked business.

WORKER
We do have the down comforter and the cookware you liked.

ELAINE
Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff.

WORKER
You know what else we have that you might like?

ELAINE
I'll take it.
[George puts on a giant Russian hat]

GEORGE
Hey, you like?
[Elaine laughs]

WORKER
I think that looks very nice on you.

GEORGE
Really? Elaine...Peterman account?

ELAINE
Why not? [To worker] And some hair for my little friend here.
[Jerry and Seth are eating at a restaurant]

SETH
So how's your stand up career?

JERRY
Pretty good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan.

SETH
You speak Japanese?

JERRY
No

SETH
So you would have done it in Japan, but in English.
[Jerry thinks for a minute]

JERRY
I don't know. So what's this job of yours?

SETH
Big investment firm. We just got the Citibank account. In fact today
was our first big meeting with them.

JERRY
The meeting you blew off?
[Seth laughs]

SETH
Yea.

JERRY
Wasn't that kind of important?
[ Seth pauses to think, and then gets worried.]

SETH
Yea.
[Jerry and Elaine are talking on the phone]

ELAINE
...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a water pic.

JERRY
You use a water pick?

ELAINE
Sure, water pic, floss, plax, brush, listerine...

JERRY
So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what two?

ELAINE
Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call.

ELAINE
Hello?

MAN
Good day Ms Benes, this is Roger Ipswitch.

ELAINE
Oh hey! How are things doing in accounting?

ROGER
Ms. Benes, I noticed you have been charging quite a bit of merchandise
on the Peterman account.

ELAINE
Well, I am the President.

ROGER
Yes, and we're all very impressed. Never the less the expense account
is for business purposes only.

ELAINE
Well, isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?

ROGER
No, I'll be in your office first thing tomorrow. Good day.

ELAINE
Good day. [Elaine and Roger hang up, leaving Jerry still on hold]

JERRY
Hello, anybody?
[George walks into Monks wearing the Russian hat.]

GEORGE
Hey.

JERRY
Hey, why didn't you get the big one?

GEORGE
This hat just bottles in the heat, I don't even need a coat! It's
unbelievable!

JERRY
I don't believe it.

GEORGE
And I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa
Tomei thing going on.

JERRY
Ah, too bad you got a little George Costanza thing going on.

GEORGE
I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.

JERRY
That's a date?

GEORGE
What's the difference? You know they way I work, I'm like a
commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear
it a few times, you hum it in the shower, by the third date it's
"By Mennen!".

JERRY
How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?

GEORGE
If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind keys, glove, scarf, I go
back to her place to pick it up...date number three.

JERRY
That's so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
[Jerry is at his apartment door]

JERRY
"By Mennen"
[Jerry notices a red dot on his door, he traces it to Kramer's peep hole,
Jerry then knocks on Kramer's door. When the door is opened a huge red light
is seen, Kramer is there smoking away on a cigar]

JERRY
What's going on in there?

KRAMER
What?

JERRY
The light!

KRAMER
Oh the red, its the chicken roaster sign, its right across my window.

JERRY
Can't you shut the shades?

KRAMER
They are shut, oh yea your friend Seth stopped by.

JERRY
Yea? What'd he say?

KRAMER
he was fired.
[Cut to Elaine's office, Elaine is trying to convince the accounting guy that
all of her expenses are business related]

ELAINE
Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the
Aristotle goose down tunic. So what do you think?

ROGER
Another bulls eye.

ELAINE
Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses are obviously for a
legitimate business purpose.
[ Elaine turns on water pic to water plants.]

ROGER
I just need to see the sable hat you purchased yesterday.

ELAINE
The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?

ROGER
Because it costs eight-thousand dollars.

ELAINE
What?
[Hits Roger with water from water pic.]
[Jerry is talking to Seth at his apartment]

JERRY
Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the
lunch with me?

SETH
We're old college buddies.

JERRY
I only knew you through Moochie.

SETH
Hey Jerry don't worry about it, the important thing is that we got to
catch up. Mind if I grab the want ads?

JERRY
Actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet.
[Exit Seth. Kramer comes over, hits the wall. ]

JERRY
How's life on the red planet?

KRAMER
Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep, all I can see is that
giant red sun in the shape of a chicken.

JERRY
Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?

KRAMER
Ah, they have me the heave ho. I don't think that Kenny Rogers has
any idea what's going on down there.
[Kramer gets out a bowl, fills it with cereal and then removes the tomato
juice from the fridge.]

JERRY
What are you doing?

KRAMER
Getting some cereal

JERRY
That's tomato juice.
[Kramer takes a big spoonful of cereal w/tomato juice!]
[Spits out cereal]

KRAMER
That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are all screwed
up! Alright, that's it I gotta move in with you Jerry.
[Kramer then spills the cereal on Jerry's wall...]

JERRY
I don't know Kramer, my only concern is that ....
[Cleans it with a dish rag....]

JERRY
..living together after a while we might start to get on each others
nerves a little.
[Squeezes juice from rag into container and puts container back in fridge]

KRAMER
Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. You're a heavy sleeper,
right? Why don't we switch apartments?

JERRY
Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make
it an eight room luxury suite.

KRAMER
Jerry these are lode baring walls, they're not gonna come down!

JERRY
Yea, that's no good.

KRAMER
I may have to drive that place out of business.

JERRY
How you gonna do that?

KRAMER
Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.
[Kramer opens door and falls back from the neon light ]
[George is dropping off the woman that sold him the hat.]

WOMAN
Thanks George, but I got it from here.

GEORGE
Oh no I'm in already come on.
[George puts down the bags he came in with]

GEORGE
So you want to get together tomorrow?

WOMAN
No, I'm gonna be pretty busy.

GEORGE
What about this weekend?

WOMAN
I'm gonna be busy for a while.
[George throws his keys on the table]

GEORGE
OK, see ya!

WOMAN
Hey, you forgot your keys.

GEORGE
What, those aren't my keys.

WOMAN
Well they're not mine.

GEORGE
Oh, they are my keys, how weird.

WOMAN
Bye George.

GEORGE
Yea.

WOMAN
George, bye!
[George places his hat on her chair, behind a pillow. ]

GEORGE
Costanza. [Like "By Mennen"]
[George and Elaine are in Elaine's office. George is looking at a bunch of
fake butterflies on the wall(?) ]

ELAINE
What do you mean you don't have the hat?

GEORGE
I left it at Heather's. Are these alive?

ELAINE
No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!

GEORGE
Alright, alright ,I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat back, I will
get a second date. Ha ha. Now watch the magic.

[GEORGE TRIES TO DIAL BUT GETS A BUSY TONE] ELAINE
Dial 9- MERLIN.
[George dials again and Heather picks up the phone]

HEATHER
Hello?

GEORGE
Heather Hi, it's George Costanza.

HEATHER
Oy!

GEORGE
Ah , listen. I don't mean to bother you but, silly me, I think I may
have left my hat in your apartment. So I thought I'd just come by
later and pick it up.

HEATHER
You didn't' leave a hat here.

GEORGE
I'm pretty sure I left it behind the cushion of the chair ...
accidentally.

HEATHER
No hat. George I gotta go.

GEORGE
You know maybe ... I'll ...
[Heather hangs up]
[Jerry is walking down the street and sees Seth emptying garbage for Kenny
Roger's Chick shack]

JERRY
Seth?

SETH
Jerry Hi! What do you think?

JERRY
I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that
couldn't be.

SETH
Yea, I'm the new manager

JERRY
But your were an executive, this is fast food.

SETH
Not fast food, good food served quickly.
[Kramer opens his window revealing a banner saying "BAD CHICKEN"]

KRAMER
Hey, stay away from the chicken, bad chicken, mess you up.

SETH
That's not going to be good for business.

JERRY
That's not going to be good for anybody.
[Kramer and Jerry are talking in Jerry's apartment. ]

JERRY
If I'm gonna live over there, you gotta take some of this stuff out.
I mean this thing is really freaking me out. I feel like its gonna
come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.
[Jerry holds up a doll]

KRAMER
Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.

JERRY
And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...
[Jerry is interrupted by the sound of a toilet flush, out comes Newman from
the bathroom]

JERRY
Oh no.

NEWMAN
Nice place you got here Kramer a man can really get some
thinking done.

JERRY
Well don't get too comfortable, as soon as Seth gets a real job you two
are gong back in that chicken supernova.
[Jerry puts on giant sunglasses and goes to Kramer's apartment. Newman starts
eating chicken]

KRAMER
What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.

NEWMAN
I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.

KRAMER
Well I'm boycotting it.
[Kramer looks at the chicken.]

KRAMER
What is that, hickory?

NEWMAN
Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.

KRAMER
Really?

NEWMAN
Uh-Huh.
[Kramer reaches for some and Newman grows,]

KRAMER
Oh stop it.
[Kramer looks like he loves it]
[Knock on Heather's door.]

HEATHER
Can I help you?
[Its Elaine, while she is talking she is dragging George in by pulling his
ear]

ELAINE
Hi, yea, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's, I'm a friend of George
Costanza's. Whether you're aware of it or not George had this
pathetic little plan to leave something behind so he could weazel a
second date.

HEATHER
Really?

ELAINE
I know, he has a real confidence problem.

GEORGE
Well not really...

ELAINE
George...Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because
you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not
be. But I really do need to have that hat back.

HEATHER
Look, I don't know what to tell you, but there's no hat here. I mean,
maybe the maid took it, I had people over, but...

GEORGE
Well that makes sense.

ELAINE
Then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?

HEATHER
Be my guest.
[George is being dragged in by his ear from Elaine]

GEORGE
Good to see you again.
[George and Elaine exit the apartment looking tired.]

GEORGE
She's bluffing, she's got it stashed away in there somewhere.

ELAINE
This is an absolute disaster.

GEORGE
Oh, I don't know. Check this out.
[George holds up a golden clock he had hidden in his jacket. ]

ELAINE
You stole her clock?
[George smiles]

ELAINE
Well done.

GEORGE
Yep, this one for our side!
[Cut to Jerry's apartment, Kramer is in Jerry's bed eating Kenny Roger's
Chicken. Kramer wipes his face on Jerry's sheets, and doing so found
another piece of chicken, Kramer throws it on the floor.]
[Cut to Kramer's apartment, Jerry is wide awake in the dark (red).]

JERRY (THINKING)
What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship.
Gotta relax.
[sound of a door opening]

JERRY (THINKING)
Hello, is somebody there? Mr. Marbles?
[Morning at Jerry apartment]

ELAINE
So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon, what am I
gonna do?

KRAMER
You should sleep with him.
[Enter Jerry, his hair is like Kramer's. Jerry enters doing Kramer's slide]

JERRY
Hey everybody, I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's
like in there, all night long things are creeping and cracking. And
that red light is burning my brain!

ELAINE
You look a little stressed.

JERRY
Oh I'm stressed!

ELAINE
So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by
four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.

JERRY
You know my friend Bob Sacamano?

ELAINE
I thought he was Kramer's friend.

JERRY
Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. we got to talking, he sells
Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.

ELAINE
fourty bucks? Are they Sable?

JERRY
No, but the difference is unnoticeable.

KRAMER
Oh yea, I like this idea.

ELAINE
Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.

JERRY
Giddee up!
[Exit Elaine and Jerry. Newman reveals himself, he was hiding in the
bathroom.]

NEWMAN
It's getting cold, it's getting cold.

KRAMER
That was a close one.

NEWMAN
Why do we have to keep this a secret from Jerry?

KRAMER
If Jerry finds out I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with
the red menace.
[Back to Elaine's office]

IPSWITCH
Ms. Benes the hat you charged to the company was Sable, this is
Neutria.

ELAINE
Well, that's a kind of sable.

IPSWITCH
No, its a kind of rat.

ELAINE
That's a rat hat?

IPSWITCH
And a poorly made one, even by rat hat standards. I have no choice
but to recommend your prompt termination to the board of directors
nothing short of the approval of Peterman himself will save you this
time.

ELAINE
But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle.

IPSWITCH
Yes, and quite mad from what I hear.

ELAINE
Wait? Can I fire you?

IPSWITCH
No.
[Cut to Monk's George and Kramer are eating together]

KRAMER
So Heather called?

GEORGE
Yea, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'.
Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?

KRAMER
No, but this is all very exciting.

GEORGE
She knows that I have her clock, I know that she has my hat, I think
she's getting ready to make an exchange.

KRAMER
Of course there's the possibility that you've gone right out of your
mind.

GEORGE
I've looked at that, seems unlikely.

KRAMER
I'd look again. So, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?

GEORGE
I can't talk to Jerry anymore, even since he moved into that
apartment he's too much ... like you.

KRAMER
That's a shame.
[Enter Jerry to Chicken Stand]

JERRY
Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off the sign?

SETH
Jerry, I lied, I'm just he assistant manager.

SETH (ON LOUD SPEAKER)
Number sixty seven, family feast.

NEWMAN
Number 67, right here, right here!

JERRY
Hello Newman.

NEWMAN
Hello Jerry.

SETH
And don't forget your steamed broccoli.

JERRY
Hold it, Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in
chocolate sauce.

NEWMAN
I love broccoli, its good for you.

JERRY
Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
[Jerry opens container. Newman takes a piece]

NEWMAN
Gladly.
[Newman spits it out]

NEWMAN
Vile weed!

JERRY
It's Kramer isn't it? The greasy door knob the constant licking of
the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?

NEWMAN
Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard.
[Newman drinks mustard like Henningins ]
[Cut to Jerry's apartment, Kramer is waiting for Newman. Jerry comes in.]

KRAMER
Newman, what took you so long, oh hey buddy.

JERRY
Expecting Newman? That's funny because I happened to find him at
Kenny Roger's Roasters.

KRAMER
Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.

JERRY
He was buying quite a load of chicken almost for two people, as long
as one of them is not him.

KRAMER
Oh hey Elaine stopped by, yea dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat, oh
she's upset at him, oh yes siree. Yea well thanks for stopping by.

JERRY
I sure do miss my apartment maybe I'll switch back.

KRAMER
Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no
choice but to put that banner back up and run that Roger's right out
of town.

JERRY
I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble,
I'll do it myself.

KRAMER
Yea, yea go ahead put the banner up doesn't matter to me.

JERRY
Alright.

KRAMER
No Jerry! I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken, you leave
those roasters alone, Kenny never hurt anybody.

JERRY
You got a little problem.

KRAMER
Oh I got a big problem Jerry!
[Elaine is visiting Peterman in the Burmese jungle. Elaine is brought in and
told to sit. ]

PETERMAN
Elaine.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman.
[A boy cuts a piece of fruit in the background, Peterman scolds him in another
language ]

ELAINE
You speak Burmese?

PETERMAN
No Elaine, that was gibberish. So did you have any trouble finding
the place?

ELAINE
No, you're the only white poet warlord in the neighborhood.

PETERMAN
Are you an assassin?

ELAINE
I work for your mail order catalog.

PETERMAN
You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.

ELAINE
Well, actually I do have a bill here, if you could just sign this
expense, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.

PETERMAN
I'd be happy to Elaine ... but I will have to see this hat.
[George and Heather are at a bench in the park. George is holding a bag.]

GEORGE
So how do you want to do this?

HEATHER
Alright George I'll be honest, the first time we went out, I found
you very irritating, but after seeing you for a couple of times, you
sorta got stuck in my head, Costanza!

GEORGE
So you really don't have my hat?

HEATHER
What?
[George moves his bag]

GEORGE
Oh. let's go do something.

HEATHER
What's in bag?

GEORGE
That's a sandwich.
[Clock starts ringing]

GEORGE
Damn salami.

HEATHER
My clock, you stole it!

GEORGE
That damn deli that is last time they screw up one of my orders.
[Starts raining ]
[Jerry enter Chicken Stand. The rain has made the rat hat (which he was
wearing) wet (or course)]

JERRY
Hey Seth, man it is coming down hard out there.
[As Jerry talks he tries to wave his rat hat dry, because of the wetness,
the hat falls apart into everyone's plate]

JERRY
Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.

SETH
That's not gonna be good for anybody.

PETERMAN
The horror...the horror.
End.
Jerry and George are sitting outside.

GEORGE
Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.

JERRY
Why are we flyin' over the Andes?

GEORGE
We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?

JERRY
Kramer.

GEORGE
So fast? What about me?

JERRY
No.

GEORGE
Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy.

JERRY
Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.

GEORGE
Well I would eat you.

JERRY
That's very nice, I guess.

GEORGE
I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.

JERRY
Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.

GEORGE
Thank you.

JERRY
Can I have a piece of that?

GEORGE
No.
% George and girlfriend Louise are at his apartment.

LOUISE
George, I can't have sex.

GEORGE
With me or in general?

LOUISE
I went to the doctor today. I have mono.

LOUISE
How long is this not gonna be a problem for me?
% Jerry's apartment...

JERRY
Six weeks?

GEORGE
Yeah, six weeks.

JERRY
Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.

GEORGE
I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.

JERRY
Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?

GEORGE
I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.

JERRY
What guys?

GEORGE
Like us. (Elaine enters)

JERRY
Yeah.

GEORGE
So it's just mono.

ELAINE
Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.

JERRY
I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.

ELAINE
No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.

JERRY
Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.

GEORGE
No something is bunk and then you debunk it.

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Huh?

GEORGE
I think. (Pause as they all look down)

ELAINE
Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings)

JERRY
Hello?

KATIE
Jerry.

JERRY
Oh hi, Katie.

KATIE
Listen, something just came up for Tuesday at the Dayton Civic Center. That's Ohio, Jerry.

JERRY
I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.

KATIE
Okay, Jerry. that's fine. you're the boss. Katie works for Jerry.

JERRY
Yes, all right, Katie.

KATIE
Sorry for the late notice.

JERRY
Yes, bye.

KATIE
You're the-- (He hangs up)

GEORGE
They asked you to do career day?

JERRY
Yeah, it's no big deal.

GEORGE
Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.

JERRY
And you were integral.
% Edward R. Murrow Junior High School, Jerry is waiting outside classroom. Teacher enters hall.

TEACHER
Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down here.

JERRY
I'm on next, right?

TEACHER
Well, unfortunately, Mr. O'Meary from the Bronx zoo...

JERRY
The guy with the lizard.

TEACHER
Yes. Well, he started feedin' it crickets, and the children just love him. And we're outta time.
% Hear kids from the classroom all say "Eww!"

TEACHER
So can you come back tomorrow?

JERRY
I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?
% Elaine and Ben eating at a restaurant.

ELAINE
So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?

BEN
I couldn't tell you. You know, I'm not really a doctor.

ELAINE
Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.

BEN
Well, I'm serious, Elaine. I went to medical school, but I still have to pass my licensing exam.

ELAINE
When do you take this exam?

BEN
I've taken it. Three times. I almost passed the last one.

ELAINE
Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.

BEN
Well, um...

ELAINE
Well, can I introduce you as doctor?

BEN
Yeah.

ELAINE
All right, that's all I wanted to know.
% George and Louise sitting on his couch. He touches her leg.

LOUISE
Mono. (George removes hand)
% Jerry and George at Monk's.

GEORGE
It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.

JERRY
So you're enjoying the not enjoying.

GEORGE
you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.

JERRY
I'm finding that out. (Kramer enters)

KRAMER
Hey, buddy. How was career day?

JERRY
Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.

GEORGE
You got bumped from career day?

JERRY
It was a mix-up, I'm sure.

KRAMER
They're trying to screw with your head.

JERRY
Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?

KRAMER
Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
% Kramer lights cigar.

GEORGE
Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.

KRAMER
No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)

LARRY
Take it outside.

KRAMER
Come on, Larry. You know me.

LARRY
It bothers people, and it's against the law.

JERRY
You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
% Outside Monk's, Kramer sees man smoking.

KRAMER
What, did they kick you out too?

MAN
Yeah, they kicked us all out.
% At Jerry's junior high school, Jerry is outside classroom with teacher.

TEACHER
Thanks so much for coming back, Jerry. Care for a graham cracker?

JERRY
No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about?

TEACHER
Fire drill. Sorry. Single file everyone!

JERRY
But I was promised this slot.

TEACHER
Single file, Jerry. (Jerry joins the line)
% At Jerry's apartment, George is sitting on couch, watching Jeopardy and playing with a Rubik's cube while Jerry is talking to him.

JERRY
Fire drill, can you believe that?

GEORGE
What is Pericles?

ALEX TREBEK
Pericles is correct.

JERRY
Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters)

KRAMER
Hey, you got any matches?

JERRY
Middle drawer.

GEORGE
Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?

ALEX TREBEK
We were looking for 'Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.'

KRAMER
Thanks. (Kramer leaves, phone rings)

JERRY
Hello?

KATIE
Jerry.

JERRY
Oh hi, Katie.

KATIE
I heard what happened to the junior high. They can't bump you like that. That is so unprofessional.

JERRY
Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem.

GEORGE
What is Borax?

ALEX TREBEK
Yes, you're right.

KATIE
They bump you in junior high, the next thing you know you're being bumped in high schools, colleges, trade schools. Before you know it, Letterman's not returning your calls. (Kramer enters)

KRAMER
Ashtrays?

JERRY
No, I don't have any ashtrays.

KRAMER
Ooh, cereal bowls.

KATIE
Jerry, now don't freak out, I'll take care of it.

JERRY
No, Katie, don't-- (He hangs up phone)

KRAMER
All right, thanks. (Kramer leaves)

GEORGE
What is Tungsten or Wolfram?

ALEX TREBEK
We were looking for 'What is Tungsten, or Wolfram'.

JERRY
Is this a repeat?

GEORGE
No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.

JERRY
Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.

GEORGE
You think?

JERRY
Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts: the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)

GEORGE
Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)

KRAMER
Need some more matches.

JERRY
What is goin' on in there?

KRAMER
I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.

JERRY
Why?

KRAMER
Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.

JERRY
It doesn't?

KRAMER
Jerry, these people aren't just going to let themselves be flicked into the ashbin of society.

JERRY
why not?

KRAMER
Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
Yeah.
% Elaine and Ben are at Monk's.

ELAINE
So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?

BEN
I dunno. Dead bodies really gross me out. (Sue Ellen Mischke enters with a man)

ELAINE
Oh my God.

BEN
What's wrong?

ELAINE
It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)

SUE ELLEN
Elaine? Hi.

ELAINE
Oh hi, Sue Ellen.

SUE ELLEN
Oh Rick, this is an old, old, friend of mine, Elaine Benes. Rick is a periodontist. He does Giuliani's gums.

ELAINE
Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.

BEN
Well, I'm an intern.

ELAINE
Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.

WOMAN
Carlitto's just passed out. Can anyone help?

ELAINE
Well, there's a doctor right here.

BEN
No there's not.

ELAINE
Can't you at least tell him what to do?

BEN
Like what?

SUE ELLEN
Shouldn't he elevate his legs?

BEN
Right. Elevate your legs!
% Elaine is giving Larry the cook flowers.

ELAINE
I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.

LARRY
I thought he was a doctor.

ELAINE
Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)

GEORGE
Of course. Absolute zero!

ELAINE
What? What is with all these books?

GEORGE
I stopped having sex.
% Outside of Kramer and Jerry's apartments. A bunch of people are in the hall, which is filled with smoke.

KRAMER
All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey.

JERRY
Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?

KRAMER
Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters)

KATIE
Jerry, oh there you are. You didn't answer the phone.

JERRY
I was out.

KATIE
Oh. Jerry, great news. I got you an assembly.

JERRY
An assembly?

KATIE
Two hours in front of the entire junior high, grades six through eight. That's six grade, seventh grade--

JERRY
I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?

KATIE
And, it is already in the school paper. They cancelled Rick James.

JERRY
Superfreak?

KATIE
Yes.
% Elaine is sitting on her couch with Ben.

ELAINE
What is your answer to number 74?

BEN
Medobolic acidosis.

ELAINE
No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!

BEN
Man, I'm never gonna pass this thing.

ELAINE
Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
% George and Yankees Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams are at the ballpark.

GEORGE
Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated.

JETER
Now who are you again?

GEORGE
George Costanza, assistant to the traveling secretary.

WILLIAMS
Are you the guy who put us in that Ramada in Milwaukee?

GEORGE
Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?

JETER
We won the World Series.

GEORGE
In six games.
% Elaine, Jerry, and George sitting at Monk's Cafe.

JERRY
...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.

GEORGE
Nine minutes.

JERRY
How am I gonna fill two hours?

GEORGE
Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.

JERRY
And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)

WAITRESS
More coffee?

GEORGE
Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?

WAITRESS
Si

GEORGE
Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.

WAITRESS
Mute pragalas senor

GEORGE
Eh, don't mention it.

ELAINE
Portuguese?

GEORGE
Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.

ELAINE
How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?

JERRY
Are you all right?

ELAINE
I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.

JERRY
Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.

ELAINE
What? What are you talking about?

JERRY
To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.

ELAINE
I don't understand.

JERRY
Exactly.
% Jerry's apartment. Kramer enters smoking.

KRAMER
Hey buddy.

JERRY
Hey.

KRAMER
Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.

JERRY
What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.

KRAMER
What?
% Kramer checks it out.

KRAMER
My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.

JERRY
It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?

KRAMER
Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood, my allure... my twinkle! Everything I have I owe to this face.

JERRY
And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.

KRAMER
Look away, I'm hideous.
% Kramer exits. Cut to Elaine's.

Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.

B
Pooh!

ELAINE
Pooh...(laughing)

B
No, it's Winnie the Pooh.
% George's apartment. George is looking through a microscope.

LOUISE
So the hospital called, turns out some stupid intern screwed up my test. I never had mono. So we can... you know.
% Monk's

JERRY
So what did you do?

GEORGE
I told her I would have to think about it.

JERRY
But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?

GEORGE
I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.

JERRY
You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.

GEORGE
Simple joke from a simple man.

JERRY
So you're never gonna have sex again?

GEORGE
Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.

JERRY
So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?

GEORGE
Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.

JERRY
I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
% Jackie Chiles is on the phone in his office.

JACKIE
My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu.
% Kramer enters.

JACKIE
Oh no.
% Jackie hangs up phone.

KRAMER
Jackie we gotta talk.

JACKIE
No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out.

KRAMER
But Jackie--

JACKIE
I said out.

KRAMER
Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.

JACKIE
The who?

KRAMER
The tobacco companies.

JACKIE
I've been wanting a piece of them for years.
% Cut to Elaine being mesmerized by a rotating tire.
% Back to Chiles' office.

JACKIE
Did that cigarette warning label mention anything about damage to your appearance?

KRAMER
No, it didn't say anything.

JACKIE
So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, unattractive, disgusting.

KRAMER
So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?

JACKIE
Your face is my case.
% Elaine enters Jerry's apartment.

JERRY
How ya doin'?

ELAINE
Not good. I'm a moron.

JERRY
Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.

ELAINE
Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?

JERRY
What for? Oh come on.

ELAINE
I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.

JERRY
I think it has something to do with me.

ELAINE
You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.

JERRY
(thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.

ELAINE
Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?
% George and Louise sit at Monk's while George is doing all sorts of scientific experiments and such.

GEORGE
You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--

LOUISE
George, I have to have sex.

GEORGE
I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.

LOUISE
Goodbye, George. I hate you. (She leaves)

GEORGE
What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches)

WAITRESS
Mais Cafe?

GEORGE
Ah. Sim, por favor.
% Kramer, and Jackie begin to discuss their to tobacco representative, Ms. Wilkie.

JACKIE
Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak.

KRAMER
Who could love me?

WILKIE
I disagree. In fact, I feel Mr. Kramer projects a rugged masculinity.

JACKIE
Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.

WILKIE
All right, Mr. Chiles. You'll have our offer by tomorrow. Good day, gentlemen. (She exits)

KRAMER
Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich.

JACKIE
You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in on your wretched disfigurement.
% Elaine's...

ELAINE
Congratulations! You passed!

BEN
Elaine, Elaine. I don't think we should see each other anymore.

ELAINE
What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?

BEN
I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew that after I became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor.

ELAINE
Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
% Backstage at the junior high's auditorium.

KATIE
Okay, Jerry, now when the glee club's finished singing, George goes on, then you. (George enters)

GEORGE
Hey.

JERRY
Where have you been? You know, you're on next.

GEORGE
I got lost on the way over.

JERRY
Got lost? We went to school here for three years.

GEORGE
What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader.

JERRY
Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!

GEORGE
No, the Portuguese waitress.

JERRY
The Portuguese waitress?

GEORGE
I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.

KATIE
George, George, you're on.

GEORGE
No, no. I'm not going on.

JERRY
Then what'd you come down here for?

GEORGE
Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.

JERRY
It's good to have you back.

KATIE
One of you has to go on.

JERRY
All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos)
% Jackie and Kramer in a cab.

KRAMER
It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks.

JACKIE
It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that offer yet.

KRAMER
Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.

JACKIE
A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? I didn't tell you to have pow-wow.

KRAMER
She made an offer. I took it.

JACKIE
How much?

KRAMER
No, no, no. There was no money.

JACKIE
No money? Then what'd we get?

KRAMER
Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it)

JACKIE
This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.
% Jerry talking on the phone with David Letterman.

JERRY
Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.

LETTERMAN
Yeah, but then, you know, some people were telling me about that little flap out there at the junior high assembly. And before that, you were bumped by a lizard?

JERRY
Actually, it was a ********.

LETTERMAN
those things, deadly dangerous. A long time ago my uncle and a date are driving, like, through Mexico. They see one on the road, drags him out of the road, and chews his face off. Listen, we'll call you if anything opens up. Okay, Jimmy?

JERRY
Jerry.

LETTERMAN
Right. Jerry.
End.

JERRY
So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.

ELAINE
I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?

JERRY
Five minutes.

ELAINE
Five minutes? That's it?

JERRY
What's the difference? You never showed up.

ELAINE
I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.

JERRY
Well, we barely knew the guy.

ELAINE
So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.

JERRY
That's the way it works.

ELAINE
When did you tell George to be here?

JERRY
I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?

ELAINE
About five.

JERRY
That's enough. <They leave. George comes around the corner.>

GEORGE (LOOKS AT HIS WATCH)
Early! Alright! <shivers.> Cold.
Commercial break.
New scene - Jerry and Kramer in a booth at the coffee shop.

KRAMER
So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.

JERRY
How did you know about that?

KRAMER
Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.

JERRY
He can't do that.

KRAMER (STERNLY)
It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.
<George enters and sits down.>

GEORGE
Fantastic day! Fantastic!

JERRY
What happened?

GEORGE
Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.

JERRY
Fantastic.

GEORGE
Then, I'm at The Foundation...

JERRY
You're still doing that?

GEORGE
Sometimes, once in a while.

JERRY
When you feel guilty.

GEORGE
No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.

KRAMER
That's caged heat.

GEORGE
Yeah-hah!

JERRY
What are you gonna do there?

GEORGE
Nothing really, you know...just stroll around the cell blocks, maybe take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?

JERRY
Yes, I know, I know.

GEORGE
I noticed you chose the "clowns with balloons" check design.

JERRY
It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
<Elaine enters with her new boyfriend, Kurt.>

ELAINE
Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.

KRAMER
Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs.

KURT
Uh, no - I only eat cage-free, farm-fresh.

KRAMER
Yes! These are sweatshop eggs. <Kramer gets up to leave by climbing over the back of the booth. He loses it and falls on the floor, then regains his composure and walks out with his napkin still tucked in his collar.>

KURT (TO ELAINE)
I gotta call the office. Honey, would you order for me?

ELAINE (SITTING DOWN)
I'm a "honey." He's pretty great, huh?

JERRY
Is he from the future?

ELAINE
No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.

GEORGE
Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. <Points to his head.> This is guts.

ELAINE
What? Clinging to some scraps?

GEORGE
These are not "scraps." These are historic remains of a once great society of hair.

ELAINE
Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!

NEW SCENE IN THE BODEGA, STARTS WITH A SHOT OF MARCELINO'S CASH REGISTER WITH JERRY'S CLOWN CHECK ATTACHED UNDER A SIGN THAT READS "CHECKS NO LONGER ACCEPTED FROM

JERRY
Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.

MARCELINO
People seem to like the clowns.

JERRY (TAKES OUT HIS WALLET)
Look, let me just give you the forty, plus another twenty for your trouble.

MARCELINO
'Kay.

JERRY (TURNING TO LEAVE)
Aren't you going to take the check down?

MARCELINO
Sorry, no. It's store policy.

JERRY
But it's your bodega.

MARCELINO
Even I am not above the policy.
<Jerry leaves while giving Marcelino a dirty look.>
New scene - George touring the women's prison with Betsy, the "warden."

BETSY
Those are our tennis courts.

GEORGE
Tennis courts? What about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?

BETSY
There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza. This is a minimum security facility.

GEORGE
Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in "the box"?

BETSY
No.

GEORGE (TO HIMSELF)
This prison stinks.

BETSY
And finally, the library, which has just been refurbished thanks to your generous donation. This is Celia Morgan, our librarian.

CELIA
Nice to meet you.

BETSY
I'll be in my office if you need me.

GEORGE
Thanks, Warden.

BETSY (SWEETLY)
Betsy.

GEORGE (DISAPPOINTED)
Betsy.

CELIA
So, are you the head of the foundation?

GEORGE
Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. <Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.> So uh, you two shop at the same store?

CELIA
No, it's standard issue.

GEORGE
Oh my God...you're in jail? <Celia nods.> That is so cool!
New scene in Jerry's apartment later that day.

JERRY
You asked her out?

GEORGE
Well...not "out." She's in prison.

JERRY
How could you ask her out?

GEORGE
Why not?

JERRY
I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!

GEORGE
That was different!

JERRY
I'll say.

GEORGE
Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. And you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?

JERRY (SHUDDERS)
The pop-in.

GEORGE
Yeah, no pop-in, no "in the neighborhood," no "I saw your light was on." And the best part is, if things go really well...

JERRY
Conjugal visit?

GEORGE (GIDDY)
Don't jinx it!
<Kramer enters.>

KRAMER
Hey. What's up?

JERRY
George is dating a convict.

KRAMER
Oh? What's she in for?

GEORGE
Embezzlement.

KRAMER (APPROVINGLY)
Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full.

JERRY
Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?

KRAMER
Well, not here. <Goes into the hallway, comes back in with a huge bag of chicken feed.>

JERRY
Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?

KRAMER
Well, it's chicken feed. <Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.>

JERRY
I sense something is afoot.

KRAMER (CLOSES FRIDGE)
Yeah, I bought a chicken.
<Jerry is about to reply, but George interrupts.>

GEORGE
Allow me. Why?

KRAMER
Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.
<George is about to reply, but Jerry interrupts.>

JERRY
Allow me. What are you, an idiot?
New scene - Elaine's apartment at night. Elaine is about to pay a delivery guy for some food.

KURT
Hold it, hold it, I got it. Catch. <Tosses his wallet to Elaine, she pays the delivery guy.>

ELAINE (LOOKING AT KURT'S DRIVER'S LICENCE PHOTO)
Hey, driver's licence. Oh...my God.

KURT
What?

ELAINE
Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.

KURT
Well, it still is. I shave my head for my swim team. I just liked the way it looked, so I kept it.

ELAINE
Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? With you under it? <Kurt shrugs.>
New scene - Jerry in bed at the crack of dawn. We hear a rooster crowing. Jerry gets up and knocks on Kramer's door, bleary-eyed. Kramer answers the door with a rooster under his arm.

JERRY
Is that your "chicken" making all that noise?

KRAMER
Oh, Jerry loves the morning.

JERRY
Who?

KRAMER
Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.

JERRY
Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not a chicken.

KRAMER
Of course it is. I picked it out myself.

JERRY
Well, you picked out a rooster.

KRAMER
Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.
<Jerry nods and shuffles back to his place. Kramer turns Little Jerry upside down to see if he's actually a rooster or not...>
New scene - George visiting Celia at the prison.

CELIA
This was fun.

GEORGE
Yeah. I had a great time.

GUARD
Five minutes, Mr. Costanza.

GEORGE
The whole hour just flew by. <Begins cleaning up the table.>

GUARD
I'll get that.

GEORGE
Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four days.

CELIA
Go out and have a ball with the guys. I'll be waiting right here for you.

GEORGE
Of course you will. You're the best.
New scene - Jerry's apartment, the same day. The phone rings.

JERRY
Hello?

HELEN (IN FLORIDA WITH MORTY)
Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced check. Are you having money problems?

JERRY
I'm not having money problems.

HELEN
Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into advertising.

MORTY
He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!

JERRY
I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine! <George enters.>

HELEN
That's it. I'm going to send you fifty dollars.

JERRY
You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!

HELEN
We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope.

JERRY (ANGRILY)
I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are gonna be so sorry!

MORTY
I don't see envelopes!

HELEN
They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... <She puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.>

JERRY
Ma! Ma! MA! <Hangs up the phone in disgust.>

GEORGE
How're the folks?

JERRY
Good.

GEORGE
So? Movie tonight?

JERRY
I thought you were going out with Celia.

GEORGE
I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!

JERRY
Having her in jail.

GEORGE
The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.

JERRY
Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.
<Elaine enters.>

ELAINE
Here. <Shows Kurt's driver's licence to Jerry.> Take a look at that.

JERRY
Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.

ELAINE
No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair. <George overhears and stands up, concerned.>

JERRY
So he just shaves his head for no reason?

GEORGE
That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!

ELAINE
And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine.

JERRY
It's just hair.

ELAINE
It's not just hair! Look! <Shows Kurt's licence to Jerry again.>

JERRY
It's brown.

ELAINE
It's chestnut with auburn highlights!

JERRY
So?

ELAINE
You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is. <They both look at George, who is reading a newspaper and struggling to keep his composure.> I'm sorry, George, but it's true.

GEORGE (CLOSE TO TEARS)
I knew it.
New scene - Kramer walking Little Jerry Seinfeld down the street on a leash. He goes into Marcelino's.

MARCELINO
Hey, Kramer. Nice rooster. What's his name?

KRAMER
Well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld.

MARCELINO
Little Jerry Seinfeld. Does he bounce checks? (laughs)

KRAMER
Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?

MARCELINO
Sorry Kramer, can't help you.
<A guy walks into the bodega with his dog. The dog and Little Jerry get into a tussle, and Little Jerry sends the dog packin.'>

MARCELINO (IMPRESSED)
I like the way he handles himself.
<Kramer picks Little Jerry up. He's upside down. Kramer turns him around the right way.>
New scene - Elaine checking out Kurt's head at her apartment.

ELAINE
Oh, it's coming in already! Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...

KURT
What?

ELAINE
Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.

KURT
What do you mean? <Goes into the bedroom to look in the mirror.>

ELAINE
Well, I don't know...how long have you been shaving your head for?

KURT (FROM THE BEDROOM)
About three years.

ELAINE
Huh.

KURT
Oh my God! <Steps into the doorway> I'm going bald!
New scene - George and Celia in the prison library.

CELIA
George! I'm so glad to see you!

GEORGE
Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice.

CELIA
Good news - I'm up for parole.

GEORGE
Parole! <Feigning joy> That's dynamite!
New scene - Kramer and Jerry in Jerry's apartment.

JERRY
So Marcelino's going to take down the check?

KRAMER
Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.

JERRY
Great! <realizing> What?

KRAMER
Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.

JERRY
Ah ha...

KRAMER
So, he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.

JERRY
Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.

KRAMER
Only in The United States.

JERRY
It's inhumane!

KRAMER
No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.

JERRY
It's two roosters peckin' at each other!

KRAMER
What?

JERRY
Yeah!

KRAMER
Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like "American Gladiators."

JERRY
No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt.

KRAMER
Well, I left him with Marcelino!
<Jerry shrugs and holds his hands out.>

KRAMER
My Little Jerry! <Runs out.>
Commercial break.
Continuation of last scene - Jerry and Kramer in Jerry's apartment.

JERRY
Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?

KRAMER
Well, he's more than O.K., he won!

JERRY
You let him fight?

KRAMER
I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.

JERRY
How long do they usually last?

KRAMER
Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.

JERRY
Great!
<George walks in.>

KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Celia's up for parole.

KRAMER
Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.

GEORGE
What?

KRAMER
Who?
<They both look at Jerry.>

JERRY
I'm too tired.

KRAMER (TO JERRY)
O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.

JERRY
Alright. <Kramer leaves.>

GEORGE (SADLY)
It's over, Jerry. She's gettin' out.

JERRY
Ah, I'm so sorry.

GEORGE
She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. <Rubs his forehead.> Talking...

JERRY
In other words, a normal relationship.

GEORGE
And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.

JERRY
Well, she'll still be an ex-con.

GEORGE
It's not the same.

JERRY
Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.
New scene - Elaine meets a bummed-out Kurt at the coffee shop.

ELAINE
Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?

KURT
I don't care.

ELAINE
You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.

KURT
Yeah...meatball...fell out of my sandwich.

ELAINE
You already ate?

KURT
It's from yesterday.
New scene - Jerry and Marcelino at the bodega.

MARCELINO
Jerry! You missed a hell of a cockfight last night.

JERRY
Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!

MARCELINO
Now we have a new deal.

JERRY
New deal?

MARCELINO
When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine, the check will be yours.

JERRY
This is outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.

MARCELINO (PUTS THE GUM ON THE COUNTER)
85 cents.

JERRY
85 cents? That is outrageous!
New scene - Jerry and Kramer in Jerry's apartment.

JERRY
Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.

KRAMER
Well, that's out of the question.

JERRY
But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.

KRAMER
Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!

JERRY
No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!

KRAMER
You know, I think you're jealous.

JERRY
Of what?

KRAMER (POINTS AT JERRY LIKE HE'S FOUND HIM OUT)
Yah, yah! You see in Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!

JERRY
Kramer, give me that rooster!

KRAMER
Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! <Kramer leaves.>
New scene - George in Betsy's office at the prison.

BETSY
George, Celia has listed you as a character reference. Whatever you can tell us would certainly be helpful in her getting paroled.

GEORGE
Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very...crafty.

BETSY
Does she have any plans after she's released?

GEORGE
Plans. Schemes. She keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends - "the gang," as she likes to call them, you know. Yeah, they're hatching something, you can count on that.
New scene - Marcelino at Jerry's apartment door.

MARCELINO
Jerry! Tonight's fight-night. Where's my rooster?

JERRY
Kramer won't sell.

MARCELINO
Well, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take down your check anyway.

JERRY
Well, thank you, Marcelino.

MARCELINO
Well, perhaps someday you will do me a favor. And that day is today. Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down in the third round of tomorrow's main event.

JERRY
You want Little Jerry to take a dive?

MARCELINO
Shhh, not so loud.

JERRY
First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.

MARCELINO
Can, too!

JERRY
Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.

MARCELINO (LEAVING)
Big Jerry is making a big mistake, Jerry.

JERRY
We'll see about that. <Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.> Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!

KRAMER
O.K.!
New scene - Kurt at George's apartment.

KURT
Elaine said you would be the best person I could talk to.

GEORGE (EXAMINING KURT'S HEAD WITH A LAMP)
Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. I've seen a lot of this.

KURT
Oh, God.

GEORGE
No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.

KURT
Happy? Why should I be happy?

GEORGE
You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - <points at Kurt's head with a pen> - then you won't be Kurt anymore.

KURT
Who will I be?
<George points at himself. Kurt shudders.>

KURT
How long do I have?

GEORGE (SOLEMNLY)
14 months. Maybe 10.

KURT
Is there anything I can do?

GEORGE
Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. <There's a knock at the door.> Excuse me.
<George answers the door. Celia enters.>

GEORGE
Celia? What are you doing here?

CELIA
Well, I didn't get my parole, so I busted out.

GEORGE (NERVOUSLY)
And you just decided to pop in...!
New scene - Kurt shows up at Elaine's apartment.

ELAINE
Kurt!

KURT
Elaine...<holds out a wedding ring> Will you marry me? <Elaine is shocked.>
New scene - Jerry and Kramer in Jerry's kitchen, training Little Jerry for his cockfight.

KRAMER
Oh, yeah. He's lookin' good, huh Jerry?

JERRY
Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. <Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.> Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! <Kramer starts filling a pot with water.> What are you doing with that?

KRAMER
I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.

JERRY
Hey, Kramer...?
<Kramer looks at Jerry.>

JERRY
Be careful. <George enters.> Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!

GEORGE
Is that good?

JERRY
I don't know. Where have you been?

GEORGE
Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!

JERRY
Oh my God! The break-out/pop-in!

GEORGE
Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -

JERRY (INTERRUPTS)
George, this is a little too much for me - escaped convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. <Jerry leaves.>
Cut back to Elaine and Kurt at Elaine's apartment.

ELAINE
Hey Kurt, slow down! I just can't marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some "fiance-time," I need some "make-my-girlfriends-jealous" time...

KURT
Plus, you want to get to know me.

ELAINE
Yeah, yeah, that too.

KURT
Well, how much time?

ELAINE
I don't know...a year?

KURT
No, no, no...it has to be now.

ELAINE
Could I see the ring again?
New scene - Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer at the cockfight in back of Marcelino's store.

JERRY (TO ELAINE)
So, you're actually considering it?

ELAINE
Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.

JERRY
Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.

ELAINE
Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to? <George comes over.>

GEORGE
Hey, sorry I'm late.

JERRY
Where's Celia?

GEORGE
She didn't want to come, she's not really into sports. <Kramer comes over with Little Jerry.>

JERRY
Hey, how's he doin'?

KRAMER
He's got a big sweat going. <Takes an envelope out of his pocket.> Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.

JERRY (OPENS THE ENVELOPE)
Fifty dollars. I don't believe this!

KRAMER
There's Marcelino. <Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.>

JERRY
Look at the size of his bird!

KRAMER
That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
New scene - Kurt at George's door. Celia answers.

KURT
Hi, is George back from the cockfight yet? You know, I gotta thank him, he changed my life.

CELIA
No, it must have been a good fight, he's not back yet.

KURT
Ah, damn.
<Two detectives show up at the door behind Kurt.>

DETECTIVE #1 (TO KURT)
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Costanza. Well, well, well. Look who's here.

CELIA
Aw, man!

DETECTIVE #2 (TO KURT)
Mr. Costanza, you're under arrest for aiding and abetting a known fugitive.

KURT (LAUGHS)
I'm not George Costanza.

DETECTIVE #2
Save it. We know you're bald. We know it's you. Let's go! <They escort Kurt and Celia out.>
Cut back to the cockfight.

ELAINE (TO A WOMAN AT THE FIGHT)
Muchos gracias. <Turns back to Jerry and Kramer.> O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!

JERRY
He's a ringer!

GEORGE
Where's the tamale guy? <The bell rings, and the cockfight begins.>

KRAMER
Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.
<A man at the edge of the ring drops Little Jerry in. Everything now happens in slow-motion.>

KRAMER (LUNGING FOR LITTLE JERRY)
Little Jerry!

JERRY
Kramer!

ELAINE
Stop the fight!

GEORGE (HOLDS UP ONE FINGER)
Tamale!
<Kramer lands in the ring and grabs ahold of Little Jerry. Marcelino's rooster closes in. We see Jerry, George and Elaine with shocked expressions on their faces, then hear pecking sounds and Kramer yelping and screaming from inside the ring.>
Commercial break.
New scene - Elaine talking to Kurt in jail on a phone through the glass.

ELAINE
Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!

KURT
They thought I was George. I'm not that bald. I have too little time left to take that kind of crap, so I slugged him.

ELAINE
So, how long are you gonna be in here for?

KURT
Well, my lawyer says 14 months, but with good behavior, maybe...10?

ELAINE
So, 10 to 14 months.

KURT
Yeah.
<Elaine hangs up the phone, takes Kurt's ring off her finger, drops it in the tray and leaves.>
End.
[Kramer's Apartment]
Kramer and Emily are in bed, having just finished their lovemaking. They're
both looking very satisfied and smiling.

KRAMER
Well, that was alright, huh?

EMILY
Yeah.

KRAMER
Well, um, goodnight.

EMILY
Goodnight.

KRAMER ROLLS OVER TO GO TO SLEEP. THE BEDSIDE CLOCK READS 12
0. Emily
snuggles up to him and puts an arm around him. Kramer doesn't look
comfortable with this.
[Kramer's Apartment, Later]

THE CLOCK READS 3
1. Kramer is lying on his back, sleeping. Beside him,
Emily lies face-down, sleeping, with her arms flung out wide. One hand is on
the pillow above Kramer's head, then it moves and Emily's forearm runs
across Kramer's face, waking him. Kramer looks disgruntled at being
awakened.

KRAMER
(quietly, to himself) Look at this.
He picks up Emily's hand and moves it back to the pillow behind his head,
only for the same thing to happen again. Emily's hand moves across his face.
Kramer looks unhappy at the disturbance.
[Kramer's Apartment, Later Still]

THE CLOCK READS 5
1. A wide awake Kramer is right over to the edge of the
bed, with Emily cuddled up to him, sleeping happily. Kramer tries to
carefully move, so as to not wake Emily, but as he shifts his weight, he
slips off the end of the mattress and falls to the floor. Emily rolls into
the space vacated, continuing to sleep.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry and his parents enter, carrying a selection of luggage.

HELEN
Jerry, we can only stay four days.

JERRY
Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.
Morty and Helen remove their coats.

MORTY
Helen, did you pack my travel gym?

HELEN
Yes. (to Jerry) Oh, your father bought a exercise device off the
television. He does it every morning at four.

MORTY
Only twenty-five minutes a day, and you can attach it to any
doorknob.

JERRY
Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.
Jerry carries two cases through into the bedroom as his parents sit on the
couch.

HELEN
Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted to talk to you about something.
Jerry reenters.

JERRY
Am I finally getting a baby brother?

HELEN
Jerry, be serious.

MORTY
How would you feel if we sold the Cadillac?

JERRY
What? The Cadillac I bought for you?

MORTY
It's too much car, Jerry.

JERRY
Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?

MORTY
I don't think we even use it.

JERRY
Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.

HELEN
We already sold it.

JERRY
Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?

MORTY
Because we had a buyer, and we couldn't get a free flight until now.

HELEN
Well, we could, but we wanted the bulkhead.

JERRY
(exasperated) Ugh.
Jerry turns away towards the kitchen as Kramer enters.

KRAMER
(to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out.

JERRY
Kramer.

KRAMER
No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. (noticing Morty and Helen)
Heyy! Seinfelds.

HELEN
Hi Kramer.

MORTY
Hiya Kramer.

JERRY
We're in the middle of a discussion here.

KRAMER
Oh yeah? What about?

HELEN
Jerry's upset we sold the Cadillac.

KRAMER
What'd you get for it?

MORTY
Jack Klompus gave us six grand.
Kramer whistles, impressed

JERRY
You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus?
Morty rises from the couch, taking a cheque out of his pocket.

MORTY
(trying to press the cheque on Jerry) And we want you to have the
money.

JERRY
(getting worked up) I don't need the money.

MORTY
What're you talking about? You had a cheque bounce at the bodega.

JERRY
(animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and
you sold a Cadillac?!

HELEN
Well, also, Jerry, we read an article in the Sun Sentinel. (digs in
her purse and extracts a newspaper clipping) It says standup comedy is not
what it used to be, what with def jam and all.
Helen passes the clipping to Jerry.

KRAMER
Yeah, that def jam is a force.

HELEN
Jerry, you know, I hear wonderful things about Bloomingdales'
executive training program.

JERRY
(sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.

KRAMER
Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had
some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that
could be the next wave.
Jerry lets out an exasperated groan, as Helen rubs his back.
[Fresh Roasted Coffee Store]
Jerry and Elaine have cups of coffee, George is ordering his beans from the
guy behind the counter.

GEORGE
Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.
The counterperson nods to George, and moves to fill the order.

ELAINE
So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?

GEORGE
I'm going to the bathroom.
George leaves.

ELAINE
Just, very interesting.

JERRY
Yeah, when it's your money, it's fascinating.
The guy behind the counter brings a bag of coffee over.

COUNTERPERSON
Arabian mocha java?

ELAINE
(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it.
Elaine takes the bag and pays for it.

JERRY
That Arabian is strong coffee.

ELAINE
It's PLO blend.
George rejoins the gang.

ELAINE
Ohh, I got your coffee.
Elaine proffers the bag to George. He takes it and reaches for his pocket.

GEORGE
Oh Oh, here, lemme uh...

ELAINE
(waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, man.
Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll see
you, okay? (begins to walk away)

GEORGE
Yeah.

ELAINE
Bye.

GEORGE
Mmm.
Elaine leaves. Jerry moves to wander out of the store also, when George
stops him.

GEORGE
You see what just happened here?

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.

JERRY
And you misinterpret this how?

GEORGE
She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.

JERRY
I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.

GEORGE
No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.

JERRY
You're crazy.

GEORGE
(worked up) Stickin' it to me, Jerry.

JERRY
George.

GEORGE
(angry) Stickin' it!
George walks off, pulling an angry face.
[Monk's]
Jerry and George sit in a booth.

GEORGE
So you're buying the car back for your parents?

JERRY
I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.

GEORGE
Your parents'll never let you do it.

JERRY
They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying
it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.

GEORGE
What kind of money you think your parents have?

JERRY
Excuse me?

GEORGE
I bet they have more money than mine.

JERRY
Come on, your parents have money.

GEORGE
You think?

JERRY
When did they ever spend any money?

GEORGE
Never.

JERRY
What are their living expenses?

GEORGE
Nothing.

JERRY
Where do they ever go on vacation?

GEORGE
Nowhere.
Jerry gives a little 'you do the math' shrug to George.

GEORGE
How much money d'you think they have?

JERRY
Few hundred grand?

GEORGE
(excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand
dollars, is that what you're saying?!

JERRY
Course you may not see it for twenty years.

GEORGE
Twenty years? That long?

JERRY
Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?

GEORGE
Fortunately, yes.

JERRY
How's your family history?

GEORGE
I have an aunt that died at seven.

JERRY
Really?

GEORGE
Aunt Baby.
[Elaine's Office]
Elaine sits behind her desk, in the big fancy office she gets standing in
for Peterman as president. Kramer enters.

KRAMER
Elaine. Uh, you got a moment?

ELAINE
Yeah, Kramer, come on in.

KRAMER
I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems.
Kramer sits in front of Elaine's desk.

ELAINE
(unsure) Oh-kay.

KRAMER
(a little anxious) You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I
don't want her in the bed any more.

ELAINE
Ah.

KRAMER
Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy
legs.

ELAINE
(confused) Jimmy legs?
Kramer raises one leg and judders it in the air, as illustration.

KRAMER
Jimmy leg.

ELAINE
(grasping the concept) Ohh.

KRAMER
So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?

ELAINE
Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?

KRAMER
Well, I'd say it nicely.

ELAINE
I don't think so.

KRAMER
Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if
I could just work out this one thing...

ELAINE
(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be
more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.

KRAMER
Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady.

ELAINE
(pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out.
Kramer starts to move, and thumps his knee on the underside of the desk. He
rises and begins to head for the door.

ELAINE
(impatient) Get out!
[Jerry's Apartment]
Morty and Helen sit on the couch, watching TV and doing a crossword,
respectively. Jerry enters from the bedroom, carrying a suitcase.

JERRY
So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at
Bally's.

MORTY
You just heard about this today?

JERRY
(pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly
called me.

HELEN
Who cancelled?

JERRY
Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.
[The Costanza Home, Queens]
George and his parents are seated at the table in the kitchen, eating a meal
of spaghetti.

GEORGE
I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby.

FRANK
(looks up to heaven) She's deceased.

GEORGE
(glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?

FRANK
(looks to Estelle) She had problems. (Estelle nods) Internal.

GEORGE
Is that common in our family?

ESTELLE
Well, your uncle Moe, he died a young man.

FRANK
Also internal problems.

ESTELLE
It's that temper on your side. They're yelling and yelling, and
then one day, they're all gone.

FRANK
What about your side? Your cousin Hennie. (animated) She was sickly
from the moment I met her!

ESTELLE
(shouts) Don't you talk about Hennie!

GEORGE
I guess you two are the lucky ones.

FRANK
So far.

ESTELLE
Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today, how old would she be?

FRANK
She'd never make it.
George thinks a little and looks hopeful.
[Monk's]
Kramer and Emily sit at a table. Emily looks a little angry.

EMILY
So let me get this straight. You enjoy the lovemaking...

KRAMER
Shh, shh.

EMILY
(quieter) Well, do you?

KRAMER
Oh yeah, like strawberry pie.

EMILY
Okay, but you have a problem sharing a bed with me?

KRAMER
I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack
time, I'm a zombie.

EMILY
I don't know.

KRAMER
(pleading) Aww, c'mon, man. Meet me halfway.

EMILY
You're not easy, Kramer.

KRAMER
I know.
[Animation]
On a map of the East Coast of the US, a long red arrow appears from New York
to Del Boca Vista.
[Klompus Home, Del Boca Vista]
Jerry sits on a chair as Jack, standing, speaks.

JACK
So, to what do I owe the pleasure of this, unannounced, visit?

JERRY
I wanna buy back the Cadillac.

JACK
You wanna buy it back? Why, you go drugs hidden in the trunk?
Jack chuckles at his own joke. Jerry stares back at him, unamused.

JACK
I'm kidding.

JERRY
(reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for
it.
Jerry puts is chequebook on the table

JACK
Nine thousand for a Cadillac? It's got no miles on it.

JERRY
You bought it for six!

JACK
You're not me.

JERRY
(standing) How much d'you want for it?

JACK
The Kelly blue book value. Twenty-two thousand dollars.
Jerry pulls a 'you have to be kidding' face.

JERRY
Fourteen thousand.

JACK
Done. But, I get to drive it tomorrow, because Doris wants to go to
Naples.
Jerry starts to write the cheque, but his pen is obviously not working
properly. Jack pulls out his own pen (the astronaut pen from 'The Pen') and
offers it to Jerry.

JACK
Need a pen?
Jerry scribbles with his pen, to try and encourage it, but to no avail. He
looks to Jack, who's holding out his pen.

JACK
Still works.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Morty and Helen are by the counter, as Kramer comes in.

KRAMER
Hey, where's Jerry?

HELEN
He's performing at Bally's in Atlantic City.

KRAMER
Aw, okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah, I need his
shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the phone
to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry
Seinfeld's room, please.

MORTY
You know that number?

KRAMER
I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well, what d'you mean, he's
not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V...

HELEN
F. F, E, L , D.

KRAMER
...F, E, L, D. (half-laughing) Well, I think you're wrong. (listens)
Alright, you have a lucky day, too.
Kramer rings off.

HELEN
He's not there?

KRAMER
No, they never heard of him.
Kramer puts down the phone, and walks off to look for the shoeshine kit.
Morty and Helen exchange worried looks.
[Restaurant]
George, Elaine and Jerry's parents sit at a table in a fancy restaurant.

ELAINE
This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George.

GEORGE
(oozing fake sincerity) Well, as much as I enjoy all the
good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on
the people I care about.

HELEN
Where's Jerry?

GEORGE
Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table and
brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian
mocha java.
George puts the gift in front of Elaine.

ELAINE
George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company.
I can afford to buy you coffee.

MORTY
(surprised) President?

ELAINE
Yeah.
Jerry enters, with his bag over his shoulder.

GEORGE
Hey look, he's back.

JERRY
I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City.

HELEN
Jerry, Kramer called Bally's. You weren't registered.

JERRY
(extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was
registered under Slappy White.
Helen looks unconvinced. A spiffily-dressed Frank and Estelle enter the
restaurant and are spotted by George.

GEORGE
Mom? Dad?

ESTELLE
Well, look who's here. Hello, Seinfelds.
Morty half-nods a greeting.

GEORGE
Wh..what're you doing here?

FRANK
We're having an upscale dinner.

GEORGE
What?

ESTELLE
Well, after talking to you, we realised we may not have much time
left.

FRANK
So, we're blowing it all.
George looks unhappy at this news.

FRANK
(holding out his tie) Look George, it's a Pierre Cardin.
[Emily's Apartment]
Once again, Kramer and Emily are basking in the afterglow.

KRAMER
That was alright.

EMILY
Yeah.
They both lie still for a few seconds.

KRAMER
(abruptly) Well, I'll see you.
Kramer climbs quickly out of the bed to leave.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Morty, dressed in exercise gear, emerges from the bedroom. He is carrying
the travel gym. He creeps across the room, so as not to wake Jerry, who is
asleep on the couch, quietly opens the door and slips outside.
[Kramer's Apartment/Hallway]
Kramer is asleep in his bed, when something wakes him. He can hear a
thumping and a rattling sound. Kramer turns over and looks across at his
door, to see the handle turning, as if someone outside were trying to open
it. A look of horror comes to Kramer's face.
Outside in the hallway, Morty has his travel gym attached to Kramer's
doorknob. As he pulls on the arrangement of cords and pulleys, they in turn
pull at the doorknob.
Inside Kramer's apartment, a terrified Kramer pulls the blankets over his
head and lies quivering underneath.
[Jerry's Apartment/Florida]
Morty and Helen are eating at the table. The phone rings and Jerry answers.

JERRY
Hello.
A dishevelled and muddy Jack Klompus is on the other end of the line, using
a cellular phone somewhere outdoors in Florida.

JACK
(shouting like there's a bad line) Jerry, I had a little mishap with
the car.
The front portion of the Cadillac is submerged in a swamp, with the tail end
pointed upwards.

JACK
I'm down here in alligator alley. You better get down here.
Jerry tries not to give anything away to his parents.

JERRY
(quiet) Huh. Alright.
Jerry puts down the phone and moves towards the bedroom.

HELEN
Who was that?

JERRY
(extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City.
They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for
tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.
Jerry leaves to the bedroom. Helen and Morty don't look convinced by Jerry's
spiel. They talk quietly so's Jerry can't hear in the next room.

MORTY
That didn't sound like the Golden Nugget.

HELEN
I'm worried. What happens if we have to support Jerry?

MORTY
I'd have to go back to work.

HELEN
Where would you work?

MORTY
Maybe I should talk to Elaine.
[Elaine's Office]
Elaine sits behind her desk, interviewing a smartly dressed Morty.

ELAINE
Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job
here.

MORTY
What's not to understand?

ELAINE
Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.

MORTY
I'm very comfortable working outta the house. I have a phone, we have
a Kinko's nearby. You know, I think that my resume speaks for itself.

ELAINE
(looking around her desk) Where is your resume?

MORTY
I don't have it. I'll mail you one.

ELAINE
Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in
mind?

MORTY
You sell clothes here, don't you?

ELAINE
Yeah.

MORTY
Well, I sold raincoats in the garment centre for thirty-eight years.
In nineteen forty-nine...

ELAINE
(interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow,
we'll find something for you to do.

MORTY
You won't regret this, Miss Benes. What time should I be in? I get up
at four, I could be here as early as four twenty-five.

ELAINE
Uhm...
Peterman enters the office.

PETERMAN
(upbeat) Oh, Elaine, this dry air is curing me like a Black Forest
ham.
Peterman strides across the office to another door.

ELAINE
(stunned) Mr Peterman. You're back.
Peterman goes through the other door, and closes it behind him. Elaine,
stands, her mouth agape in shock.

MORTY
Who's Mr Fancy?
[Emily's Apartment]
Kramer and Emily in bed again.

KRAMER
(hesitant) I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.

EMILY
Aww, that's sweet, but actually I, I think I'd prefer it if you left.

KRAMER
(surprise) What?

EMILY
You were completely right. I sleep so much better when I'm alone.
(pause) And you scream in your sleep.

KRAMER
I do?
Kramer looks intensely nervous.

KRAMER
(fearful) There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment
last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.

EMILY
C'mon, it was probably the wind.

KRAMER
No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen,
you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and
I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.

EMILY
(adamant) Well, I do.
[Animation]
Another arrow is drawn from New York to Del Boca Vista.
[Street, Del Boca Vista]
A tow truck has hauled the Cadillac out of the swamp and back to Del Boca
Vista. It's plastered with mud and filth over its entire length. Jack
Klompus stands beside it, still mud-spattered. Jerry climbs out of a cab.

JACK
What took you so long?

JERRY
I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened?
The cab drives away.

JACK
This thing is a, is a behemoth.

JERRY
What did you do?

JACK
I was, I was making a, a simple lane change. I, I put on the blinker
and it took off on me. And the next thing you know, I was submerged. I'm
telling you, Jerry, I'm very lucky that those crocs didn't get me.
Jerry opens the door of the Cadillac and a torrent of muddy water containing
a couple of catfish spills out over his feet.

JERRY
(exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car
cleaned up for my parents.

JACK
(shrugging) Do whatever you want. It's your car.

JERRY
My car? You drove it into the swamp!

JACK
It drove itself into the swamp! Besides, I think I lost my pen, too.

JERRY
(smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all
worthwhile.
[The Costanza Home, Queens]
Frank and Estelle sit in the living room as George walks in from the front
door.

GEORGE
(pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the
house?

FRANK
That's your mother's new car.

GEORGE
You bought that?

FRANK
It's a Coupe de Elegance.

ESTELLE
Your father wanted a Mercedes, but I won't ride in a German car.
George looks like he's going to say something, but then the door to the
kitchen opens and Kramer walks in, wearing a dressing gown and pyjamas and
carrying a mug of coffee. He slaps George on the back.

KRAMER
Mornin'.
Kramer walks round the stunned George, and sits on the couch.

KRAMER
Oh, boy.

GEORGE
What the hell is going on here?

KRAMER
I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night
to sleep.

ESTELLE
George, your mother and I, and Kramer (holds Kramer's hand) have
been talking.

GEORGE
(dread) Oh god.

KRAMER
Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this
community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place
where they should be.

FRANK
(claps his hands) You can drop a grand in Disneyworld, like that.

GEORGE
Wait a minute. (astonished) You're thinking of moving to Florida
again?!

ESTELLE
Well, it's either that or we stay here, near you, and just sit on
the money. What do you think we should do, Georgie?
George looks surprised, confused and thoughtful, all at the same time.
[Peterman's Office]
Peterman sits behind his desk in the office which was, until recently,
Elaine's. Employees sit around the desk, including Morty and Elaine, who
sits depressed at the end of the desk.

PETERMAN
So, anyway, effective immediately, Miss Benes will return to her
old position, at her original salary...
Elaine does a double take at this, and looks unhappy.

PETERMAN
...and I, of course, will return to mine. Kudos, Elaine, on a
job... done.

ELAINE
(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?

PETERMAN
I think not.
Elaine puts a hand to her head and sighs.

PETERMAN
Now, down to business. (thoughtful) I have had this vision of a
diaphanous rum-runner scarf.
The employees take notes.

ELAINE
Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about
a thousand dollars a bolt.

MORTY
(shocked) A thousand?! I know a coupla Chinamen over there on
Forty-third Street, who'll do it for half that.

ELAINE
(tactful) It's, ah, Asian-Americans.

MORTY
What?

PETERMAN
(puzzled) Who are you?

ELAINE
Don't worry, I...

MORTY
Morty Seinfeld. I cut velvet for forty years with Harry Altman.

ELAINE
Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...

PETERMAN
Elaine, did you hire this man?

ELAINE
(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern,
you know, at best.
[Monk's]
George and Elaine sit in a booth.

ELAINE
So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.

GEORGE
(pointing out the positive) But happy.

ELAINE
Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...
Elaine gestures with her hand.

GEORGE
Obviously.

ELAINE
Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.

GEORGE
No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't
solved anything yet.

ELAINE
Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go.

GEORGE
What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.

ELAINE
Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...

GEORGE
(upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you
could humour me. He humours me.

ELAINE
Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at
Peterman's.

GEORGE
You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is
breathing down my neck?

ELAINE
What?

GEORGE
You schedule a late meeting.

ELAINE
(puzzlement) Huh? What does that do?

GEORGE
These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped.
(animated) How did we get back onto you?!

ELAINE
(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.
Elaine gets up and leaves.

GEORGE
(shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this!
[The Costanza Home, Queens]
Kramer, wrapped in a quilt enters the Costanza's bedroom. Frank enters from
the bathroom, drying his hands with a towel.

KRAMER
Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.

FRANK
That's right. That's me on the left.

KRAMER
So, you sleep in separate beds.

FRANK
Thirty years ago, we came to an agreement. It was the only way I
could get some rest.

KRAMER
(intrigued) Really?

FRANK
(confidential) Estelle's got the (jerks his elbow) jimmy arms.

KRAMER
You can get that in your arms?

FRANK
Like you wouldn't believe.
[Klompus Home, Del Boca Vista]
A grubby Jerry sits at the table, with Jack hovering over him.

JACK
Jerry, it's getting late. You've cleaned up the car. You've made all
your phone calls. Why are you still here?

JERRY
Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash
for a hotel room. So...

JACK
You are uh, thinking of staying here?

JERRY
Well...

JACK
(laughing) You've got some nerve. I almost break my neck in that
death-trap of yours, and now you ask me for a favour!

JERRY
You didn't like that crack about the pen.

JACK
I did not.
[The Costanza Home, Queens]
George and his parents sit at the kitchen table, while Kramer does some
washing up in the sink.

GEORGE
Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...
George is distracted momentarily by Kramer clattering dishes. He gives
Kramer a look and continues.

GEORGE
(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you
living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too
much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay.

FRANK
It's too late. We bought a condo at Del Boca Vista. We're leaving
tonight.
Estelle and Frank smile at each other.

GEORGE
(crestfallen) But you said it was my call.

ESTELLE
We were just being nice.
George looks crushed.

ESTELLE
(motherly concern) Cosmo, are you sure you're gonna be alright here
alone?

KRAMER
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.

GEORGE
(animated) You're letting him have a woman over?!

FRANK
He's not family. It's different, psychologically.
Kramer is examining the label on a wine bottle, as George turns to look at
him. He gives George a little smile.
[Peterman's Office]
The employees, including Elaine and Morty, sit round Peterman's desk as he
waxes lyrical about his adventures. Morty looks impatient, glancing at his
watch as Peterman speaks.

PETERMAN
And so, I made an explosive out of chick peas, and I stopped that
great rhino right in his tracks.

MORTY
Well, it's getting kinda late, why don't we uh...

ELAINE
Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced
mortal danger.

PETERMAN
(smiles and laughs) Ha ha ha. Funny you should ask, Elaine.

MORTY
Look, if we're gonna stay here until all hours of the night, can we
at least get some food here?

PETERMAN
(looks at his watch) It's only five fifteen. So, later on that
same day, I developed a great hankering for some wild honey...

MORTY
(standing) Okay, I'm done. I'll be back in the morning, when he's
close to finish with his story.
Morty heads for the door. Peterman's voice brings him to a halt.

PETERMAN
Morty. My stories are what sell these clothes.

MORTY
Cheap fabric, and dim lighting. That's how you move merchandise.

PETERMAN
(winks) Morty, you're out.

MORTY
(unconcerned) Ach, I never knew what the hell I was peddling with
those stupid cartoons and that paper book, anyway.
Morty walks out, leaving a not entirely unhappy Elaine behind.
[Animation]
An arrow is drawn on the East Coast map, this time from Queens to Del Boca
Vista.
[Street, Del Boca Vista]
Frank walks along the sidewalk, past a familiar looking Cadillac. Something
catches his eye, and he looks into the car. A figure is asleep on the back
seat with his face covered. Frank 'gives a what is the world coming to' look
and throws up his hands as he walks away.
After he leaves, the figure shifts in his sleep, turning over. It's Jerry,
sleeping in his parent's Cadillac.
[The Costanza Home, Queens]
Kramer stands in the doorway of the bathroom, while Emily sits on Estelle's
bed, reading a paperback.

KRAMER
I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at
Snitzer's.

EMILY
(not looking up from her book) No-one held a gun to your head.

KRAMER
(dismissive) Yeah.

EMILY
(still reading) Don't forget, we're eating dinner at the Feinerman's
tomorrow night.

KRAMER
(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.

EMILY
You like 'em.

KRAMER
I've had it with 'em.
Kramer disappears into the bathroom.

EMILY
Then we won't go.
Kramer reemerges with a glass of water.

KRAMER
(yielding) Okay, okay. What time?

EMILY
Eight thirty.
Kramer downs the glass of water in one go, and then belches.

KRAMER
(satisfied) Ahh. That was alright.
Emily smiles at him, then returns to her book.
[Monk's]
Jerry, George and Elaine sit in a booth. Jerry drinking coffee, George
eating and Elaine reading from the pages of a newspaper.

ELAINE
'One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J
Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a
half points.'
Elaine folds the paper and drops it on the table.

JERRY
Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...

ELAINE
(downcast) Yeah.

GEORGE
(Jerry-style) That's a shame.

ELAINE
(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?

GEORGE
(innocent) What?

ELAINE
I think you're sticking it to me.

JERRY
Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.

ELAINE
(leaning forward and accusing) Stickin' it!
George doesn't meet Elaine's stare.

JERRY
You're not alone. I'm practically broke.

ELAINE
Really?

JERRY
No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.
George takes another forkful of what's on his plate.

GEORGE
(relishing) Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Delicious.

JERRY
Well, you seem happy.

GEORGE
I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking
in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!

ELAINE
So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?

JERRY
Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet.

ELAINE
Hmm.
[Florida]
Morty and Helen sit on a couch, reading magazines.

MORTY
When are we gonna tell Jerry?

HELEN
I don't wanna worry him. We'll tell him next time we go up.

MORTY
He thought he could buy back that Cadillac for us? He's not getting
away with that.
It's revealed that the Seinfelds are in a trailer parked behind the
Cadillac.

HELEN
Besides, that condo was too much house.
[The Costanza Home, Del Boca Vista]
Estelle is sitting on the couch in the condo, while Frank peers out of the
window.

ESTELLE
How many times can you check the car?

FRANK
(coming away from the window) I saw a bum sleeping in a Cadillac the
other day.
Frank sits in a chair.

ESTELLE
Why would someone break into a car to take a nap?

FRANK
They don't nap. They make it their home. They urinate in there!

ESTELLE
(shouts) You're driving me crazy!

FRANK
(standing) That's it, we're going back to Queens. (claps hands)
Where's my hat?
Frank walks out of the room.

ESTELLE
(shouts) Nooh!
End.
[Yankee Stadium, Conference Room]
A group of staff, including George, are gathered round the table. There's a
bunch of food on the table. Most people have a small plate with a few salad
leaves on it in front of them. George is picking shrimp off a platter,
dipping them in some sort of sauce, and stuffing his face with them, about as
fast as he can manage.

BILL
Well, if the big man wants a new scoreboard, I don't wanna be the one
to tell him no.

REILLY
No-one in the park is gonna be able to see it from there.

GEORGE
(through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, why don't we just put a monitor
in his skybox?

REILLY
Hey George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.
Everyone at the table starts laughing uproariously at Reilly's joke. George
looks upset, and barely forces half a sick smile past his mouthful of
seafood.
[George's Car]
George drives along. He's fuming at Reilly's dig.

GEORGE
(angry, to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta
shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! (frustrated
shout) Dammit!
[New York Health & Racquet Club]
George and Jerry come along a corridor. They're carrying bags and
paraphernalia indicating they've been playing tennis.

JERRY
'The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'?

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk
store called, and they're running outta you.'
Jerry and George halt at a bench by the entrance to the pro shop. Jerry
rummages in his bag, producing an old-fashioned wooden framed tennis racquet.

JERRY
(smiling) Really? That's great. You said that to him?

GEORGE
(confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.

JERRY
Oh. That's not quite the same.

GEORGE
No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.

JERRY
I'm gonna grab a can of balls.

GEORGE
Right.
George heads on down the corridor. Jerry walks into the pro shop, carrying
his gear. There are a few customers browsing. Milos (East European, tracksuit
wearing, slicked back hair with pony tail) comes over to Jerry.

MILOS
Hello. My name is Milos. How can I help you.

JERRY
I need a can of balls.
Jerry stands before the counter, holding the old-fashioned racquet. Milos
reaches under the counter and pulls out a can of tennis balls.

MILOS
Can of balls for the nice guy, alri...
Milos stops and stares disapprovingly at Jerry's racquet.

MILOS
...Ahh. You don't plan to hit these balls with that racquet, do you?
Jerry looks surprised.
[Champagne Video]
Inside a typical small video rental store, Elaine stands before a rack marked
'Staff Picks'. Individual shelves are labelled 'Elizabeth', 'Gene', and
'Vincent', amongst others. Elaine is reading the back of a video box, when
Kramer comes up behind her.

KRAMER
Checking out the staff picks, Miss Benes?

ELAINE
Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent
guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.

KRAMER
Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.

ELAINE
Gene? Oh, it's so stupid and mainstream.

KRAMER
(indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer
pick.
Kramer holds up a video for Elaine's inspection.

ELAINE
(reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that
one.

KRAMER
Yeah, went straight to video.
Elaine looks upon this as a negative.

KRAMER
(positive) That makes me the premiere.
Kramer takes his cassette toward the counter.

ELAINE
(gets Kramer's point) Hah.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Kramer is talking seriously to Jerry, whilst holding a piece of paper.

KRAMER
Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?

JERRY
No. <img src="http://tinyurl.com/2rau"> 

KRAMER
It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching
it, so I want you to read this.
Kramer hands the piece of paper to Jerry.

JERRY
(reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side
Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie,
hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine,
lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'

KRAMER
Can you do that for me, buddy?

JERRY
Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding
document.

KRAMER
Well, I'm gonna type it up.

JERRY
Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.

KRAMER
Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me.
(frustrated) I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I
couldn't even give him his Christmas present.
Jerry nods sympathetically. Kramer spots something on the table.

KRAMER
Oh, hey, new racquet, huh?

JERRY
Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy
Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.
Kramer takes a few practice strokes with the racquet.

JERRY
In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.

KRAMER
(picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this any
more.
Kramer deposits the old wooden racquet in Jerry's trash. Jerry notices
something about the piece of paper Kramer gave him.

JERRY
(accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.

KRAMER
(explaining) Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures
page.
Kramer swings the new racquet again, making ball-smashing sound effects.
[Elaine's Apartment]
Elaine sits up in bed, watching her video rental. She dabs a tear from her
eye, and sniffs.

ELAINE
(emotional) Oh. Oh, bravo, Vincent. Bravo. (sniffs)
The phone rings. Elaine reaches over and picks up, not happy at being
interrupted.

ELAINE
What?

VINCENT (O.C.)
Did you enjoy the movie?

ELAINE
Who is it?

VINCENT (O.C.)
It's Vincent.

ELAINE
Of Vincent's picks?

VINCENT (O.C.)
The same.
Elaine smiles excitedly.
[Tennis Club]
Elaine and Jerry have been playing tennis at a different club from the one we
saw earlier. They're packing away their stuff. At another court, behind them,
a guy in baseball cap and dark glasses is playing truly awful tennis. He's
missing the ball, falling over, flailing wildly with his racquet.

JERRY
He called you?

ELAINE
He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for,
like, two hours.

JERRY
To a guy you've never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process is
getting ever more rigorous.
Elaine sticks out her tongue at Jerry.

ELAINE
Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets
his own hours.
A tennis ball bounces by Elaine, and she grabs it. The terrible player from
the other court shouts over.

PLAYER (O.C.)
Little help, hey!

ELAINE
(tossing the ball back) Yeah.

PLAYER
Thank you.
The ball Elaine tossed back eludes the player's grasp, misses his racquet and
bounces away past him.

ELAINE
(laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible.

JERRY
(pulling on a jacket) Mmm-hmm.
The terrible player continues to swing ineffectually at easy balls in the
background.

ELAINE
Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?

JERRY
George used up all my guest passes already.

ELAINE
Ah.

PLAYER
Ahh.
A ball bounces past Elaine, and Jerry grabs it.

JERRY
Come on.

PLAYER
Thank you.
The awful player comes over to get the ball back. As he approaches, he
removes his sunglasses and wipes his brow with his forearm.

JERRY
(tossing the ball) Here you go.
The player catches the ball and raises his head, so we can see his face. It's
Milos, the guy who sold Jerry his new racquet.

JERRY
(disbelief) Milos?

MILOS
(shock) Oh, hey. (puts sunglasses back on) How you doing?
Milos looks guilty, and shouts across to his playing partner as he walks away
from Jerry.

MILOS
Okay, we should uh, wrap it up here.
Milos bounces the ball on the court and tries to hit it over the net. He
fails, despite being no more than four feet from the net. Jerry looks down at
his new racquet, thoughtfully.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Elaine and Jerry have just arrived from the tennis club, and are putting
their stuff on the table. Elaine is removing her coat.

ELAINE
So he was bad. What d'you care?

JERRY
Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said
it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.
The door opens and Kramer enters, smartly dressed, with a suit and tie.

KRAMER
Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna
set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.

ELAINE
The executor? Of what?

JERRY
Kramer wants to die with dignity.

ELAINE
There's a feather in your cap.

KRAMER
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. (snaps
fingers)
The door opens and George wanders in, looking pleased with himself.

GEORGE
Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.

JERRY
D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?

GEORGE
I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I
can get him to try that line again.

ELAINE
Who's Reilly?

JERRY
George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey,
George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'
Elaine laughs, loud and long, causing Jerry and Kramer to smile and laugh.

GEORGE
Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store
called. They're running outta you.'
George smiles and looks expectant. The other three just stare at him, with
varying levels of confusion in their expressions.

GEORGE
(worked up) Wha...You gotta be kidding me?!

ELAINE
How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some
space to rent.'?
Elaine laughs, and Jerry smiles.

GEORGE
(confused) What does that mean?

JERRY
(taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called.
You're due back by six.'

GEORGE
(frustrated) No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.

KRAMER
Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.

GEORGE
(shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.

KRAMER
Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how
would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...

GEORGE
(really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate
writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it
all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk
store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!
George walks out the door. The other three watch him go. Kramer walks over
and looks out the door after George, then returns and spots Jerry's old
racquet on a stool.

KRAMER
(picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage?

JERRY
Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.

KRAMER
Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) How
are you gonna be the executor of my living will?
Jerry retrieves the racquet from the trash.

KRAMER
(indicating) You see? You can't let go.

JERRY
Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.

KRAMER
I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time
tomorrow afternoon?

ELAINE
Me?

KRAMER
Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted
businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind
stomping on a few throats.

ELAINE
(smiling, flattered) Oh, ho, c'mon.
[Lawyer's Office]
Kramer and Elaine sit before a desk, behind which sits Shellbach the lawyer,
who has a large list in front of him, from which he's reading. Kramer looks
nervous, while Elaine is tapping at a soda can, looking bored.

SHELLBACH
Situation number four. You're breathing on your own, you're
conscious, but with no muscular function.

KRAMER
Well, would I be able to communicate?

SHELLBACH
I don't see how.

ELAINE
Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.

KRAMER
Huhh, yeah, let's pull the cord.

ELAINE
Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower.

SHELLBACH
Moving on. You have liver, kidneys and gall bladder, but no
central nervous system.
Kramer looks at Elaine, who gives a double thumbs-down.

KRAMER
Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.

SHELLBACH
Okay. One lung, blind and you're eating through a tube.

KRAMER
Naw, that's not my style.

ELAINE
Bore-ing.

SHELLBACH
Alright, you can eat. But machines do everything else.

KRAMER
(hesitant) Uhm...
Kramer looks to Elaine, who nods.

ELAINE
I'd stick.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah. Stick. (to Elaine) 'Cos I could still go to the coffee
shop.

ELAINE
(points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right.
[New York Health & Racquet Club]
A grim-looking Jerry stalks into the pro shop and over to the counter to be
met by a nervous and apologetic Milos.

JERRY
Hello Milos.

MILOS
Jerry, thank god you got my message. Thank you so much for coming down
here. Uhm, listen...

JERRY
(animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because
I thought you knew what you were talking about.

MILOS
I..I...

JERRY
You can't even play.

MILOS
Believe me, it is Milos great shame. But Jerry, I could lose my
business if anybody find out. How would you like extra year membership of the
club? Free. No charge.

JERRY
You could do that?

MILOS
Jerry, for you, anything.
Jerry looks happier. Milos walks away behind the scenes somewhere. Jerry
looks round the store and exchanges smiles with a beautiful woman who's
trying on a visor. After a few moments, Milos returns, looking rueful.

JERRY
(indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos?

MILOS
(apologetic) Hah, Jerry, I am so sorry. they tell me there is no way
they can do it. (meek) Is there anything else I can do for you? Anything at
all. I refund your money.

JERRY
(animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I
just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...

MILOS
Shhh-shhh. (whispers) I make it up to you.

JERRY
(doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me.
Jerry turns away and walks toward the door. As he passes the beautiful woman,
he speaks.

JERRY
Tennis, anyone?
The woman smiles at Jerry's flirtation. Jerry leaves, and Milos looks after
him, worried.
[Champagne Video]
Kramer and Elaine stand before the 'Staff Picks' rack again. Elaine picks a
video off the 'Vincent' rack.

ELAINE
Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning.
(reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred
and ninety-two minutes?

KRAMER
That's a lotta yearning, huh?

ELAINE
You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally
exhausting.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.

ELAINE
Really?

KRAMER
(looking at 'Gene' rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? (pulls
down a cassette) Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's
an hilarious premise.

ELAINE
(laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well...

KRAMER
Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernie's II box)

ELAINE
Yeah, I could use a chuckle.
Elaine returns the 'Vincent' pick to the shelf and walks toward the counter
with the Bernie's tape.

KRAMER
(approving) Yeah.

ELAINE
What're you getting?

KRAMER
Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness.

ELAINE
Oh. How much you got left?

KRAMER
Yeah, about two hours.
Elaine does a double-take at this.

KRAMER
Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.
[Elaine's Apartment]
Elaine sits up in bed, watching her video. She's not enjoying it.

ELAINE
(at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because
he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how long
is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh!
The phone rings, and Elaine picks up, glad of the interruption.

ELAINE
Hello.

VINCENT (O.C.)
(accusing) How's the movie. Elaine?

ELAINE
Vincent?

VINCENT (O.C.)
(betrayed) The Gene pick. How could you? I thought we had
something special.

ELAINE
(defensive) No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind
it.
There is a click as Vincent hangs up.

ELAINE
Vincent?
[Yankee Stadium, Conference Room]
The table is ringed with employees again, and there is more food. George is
stuffing his face with shrimp, just as before. There are a couple of empty
seats. One more guy (Fred) enters, and moves to sit at the table.

FRED
Alright, let's get to it.

GEORGE
Wha..wait a minute, wha..what about Reilly?

FRED
Reilly doesn't work here any more.

GEORGE
(surprise) What? I..I didn't hear about that.

FRED
Oh, we only wake you up for the important meetings.
Everyone at the table collapses into laughter at George's expense. Again,
George do nothing but look upset at the turn of events.
[Street]
Jerry is walking along the street, when he encounters the beautiful woman
from the pro shop, who appears to have been waiting from him.

PATTY
Hello.

JERRY
Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?

PATTY
I think so. I'm Patty. Milos gave me your address. I hope you don't
mind me waiting for you here.

JERRY
(to himself) Hoh, that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh, what shall we do,
uhm, care for a cup of coffee?

PATTY
Why don't we just go up to your apartment?

JERRY
(surprised) Alright.
Patty strolls past Jerry, and indicates he should follow.

JERRY
(to himself) Gotta be an easier way.
Jerry turns to follow Patty.

Doctor, how's her coma?

DOCTOR (O.C.)
Oh, exactly the same.
Kramer enters the room, with a bowl of spaghetti. He sits on the couch to
watch the movie, and lifts a big forkful into his mouth.

DOCTOR (O.C.)
Wait a minute, she's coming out of the coma.
Kramer stops chewing and stares wide-eyed at the TV screen.

DOCTOR (O.C.)
Mrs Allbright, can you hear me? Are you okay?

ALLBRIGHT (O.C.)
(bright and cheerful) I feel so rested and refreshed. Get
me a toothbrush.
Kramer continues to stare at the screen, stunned by the outcome of the movie.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry hands a drink to Patty as she stands by the kitchen counter.

JERRY
So, you play tennis?

PATTY
(putting the glass down on the counter) Enough talk, Jerry.
Patty advances on Jerry, sexily. Jerry looks somewhat surprised.

JERRY
Not for me, I love chatting.

PATTY
(putting her hand to Jerry's face) Shh.
Patty leans toward Jerry, as though to kiss him. Just as she's about to kiss,
she breaks away.

PATTY
(anguished) No! No, I can't do this. (moving away) I can't go through
with it. (sitting on the couch) Not even for him!

JERRY
Who?

PATTY
(cries) Milos. My husband!

JERRY
(shocked) Your husband?!
Patty puts her face down on the couch, weeping. Jerry, puts his hands up in
the air, in a gesture of total disbelief.
[Jerry's Apartment]
George sits on the couch, just making sure he's got Jerry's story straight.
Jerry listens.

GEORGE
So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak
out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?

JERRY
(explanation) He's new around here.

GEORGE
(hopeful) So, details?

JERRY
(walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her.

GEORGE
Because of society, right?

JERRY
(weary) Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting
turn out?
Jerry is getting some sort of candy bar out of a packet on the counter.

GEORGE
Reilly is no longer with the club. (getting up) You believe that?
George wanders over into the kitchen.

JERRY
Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.
George looks in the fridge.

GEORGE
Yeah, I'm gonna let it go.

JERRY
You never really had the right comeback, anyway.
George jerks out of the fridge, slamming the door.

GEORGE
(animated) Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked
him, I say.
George walks back into the living room and picks up a newspaper. The door
opens and Kramer enters.

KRAMER
Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie,
The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end.

GEORGE
(frustrated) Ohh, I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in
frustration) Thanks. Thanks a lot.
George stalks away into the bathroom, and slams the door behind him.

KRAMER
I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.

JERRY
I didn't know it was possible not to know that.

GEORGE (O.C.)
(from bathroom) How was Eric Roberts as the husband?

KRAMER
(shouting back) Oh, unforgettable.

GEORGE (O.C.)
(disappointed) Oww.

KRAMER
(nervous) I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug.
Kramer opens the door and exits hurriedly.
[Champagne Video]
Elaine walks over the 'Vincent' rack, where she finds nothing but copies of a
video called Betrayed.

ELAINE
What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I...
Kramer enters the store and hurries over to Elaine.

KRAMER
Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma
thing. (positive) Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.

ELAINE
Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?
The store manager comes over and squeezes past Elaine.

MANAGER
Excuse me.

<IMG SRC="HTTP

The manager removes the 'Vincent' label from the shelf and replaces it with
another name.

ELAINE
What're you doing?
The manager walks back to behind the counter.

ELAINE
Wha..wha...?

MANAGER
Vincent stopped making picks.

ELAINE
(upset) Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?

MANAGER
We have a wide variety of Gene picks.

ELAINE
(dismissive) Gene's trash.

MANAGER
I'm Gene.
Elaine looks sick at her error. Kramer smiles and raises his eyebrows.

ELAINE
(forcing a smile) Hi.
[New York Health & Racquet Club]
A subdued Milos is behind the counter, before which stands Jerry.

JERRY
Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about
your unbelievably bad tennis playing.

MILOS
(not cheered) Thank you, but, unfortunately, I have much larger
problems to fry. My wife, she has no respect for Milos anymore.

JERRY
I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.

MILOS
Patty, she, she loves tennis, as much like I do. (hopeful) Wou..would
you, wi..will you let me beat you in tennis? That is the only way I can show
her I am still a man.

JERRY
(reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around.
I mean, I wanna be a man too.
[Monk's]
Jerry and Elaine sit in a booth.

JERRY
So you hurt Vincent's feelings?

ELAINE
(handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today.

JERRY
(taking the envelope) Wh..What's this?
Jerry opens the envelope and shakes a small object out onto his palm.

ELAINE
It's the play button, off his VCR.

JERRY
(examining the button) Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a
tooth.
George enters and strolls over to the booth.

GEORGE
(sitting) So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working
for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.

ELAINE
Ohio? 

GEORGE
Yep. I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning.

JERRY
(nonplused) You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?

GEORGE
Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect
as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.

ELAINE
See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is
all.

GEORGE
(adamant) It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will
appreciate it. (shouting) And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead
mass audience!
George realises that everyone in the coffee shop is staring over at him, and
has heard his shouts.

GEORGE
(waving apologetically) Not you.
[Elaine's Apartment]
Elaine is again sitting up in bed, watching a video. (My guess is it's The
Pain And The Yearning.) The soundtrack can be heard.

OLD WOMAN (O.C.)
Oh, brittle bones. How I long to be rid of the pain.
The phone rings and Elaine picks up.

ELAINE
Hello.

VINCENT (O.C.)
Elaine? It's Vincent.

ELAINE
(surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet you.

VINCENT (O.C.)
No. I can't bear to have anyone see me.

ELAINE
Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does.
You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. (blunter) Now, let's
have a look at you.

VINCENT (O.C.)
(relenting) Alright, but, can you bring me few things from
the store? I haven't been out in a while.
[Kramer's Car]
Kramer drives along the street, very slowly. He's got traffic stacked up
behind him and horns blare as cars manoeuvre around him. Kramer is hunched
over the steering wheel, looking nervous.

KRAMER
(indicating that cars should pass him) Well, go around, you bunch of
crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed.
[Lawyer's Office]
Kramer stands expectantly in the office. A secretary enters.

SECRETARY
Hi, can I help you?

KRAMER
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul
my living will.

SECRETARY
Oh. (looks at her watch) Mr Kramer, you had a ten-thirty
appointment. It's two o'clock. Mr Shellbach had a tennis lesson. He's gone
for the day.
Kramer looks anxious again.
[Tennis Club]
Jerry and Milos are playing at the other tennis club. They are watched by a
small number of people, including Patty. Milos delivers a weak underarm
serve, and Jerry makes no effort to return it, merely wafting his racquet
vaguely in the direction of the ball.

JERRY
Too good.

MILOS
(triumphant shout) Another game for Milos!! Hahaha!
Milos walks to the net to meet Jerry.

JERRY
You're on fire today.

MILOS
(shouting over) Hey Patty. look at this guy. He's awful!
Patty blows Milos a kiss.

MILOS
(milking it) He's not a man, this Jerry. He's not even married like I
am. (laughs) Huhuhuhu.

JERRY
(quietly) Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could
you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?

MILOS
(shouting) Hey everybody, look! The little chicken girl wants me to
ease up. He can't handle this, so he cries like a woman! (laughs evilly)
Hahaha!
Milos strides away to continue the game, leaving Jerry looking rueful.
[Outside Vincent's Apartment]
Elaine walks down a hallway, carrying a large grocery bag. She reads numbers
off doors until she spots the one she wants. She gives a smile, flicks her
hair a little, and knocks at the door.

ELAINE
Hello? Vincent?
The door cracks open a few inches, but it's completely dark inside, so the
occupant can't be seen.

VINCENT
Elaine?

ELAINE
I got what you asked.

VINCENT
Just, leave it and go.

ELAINE
W..well, can't I come in?

VINCENT
No. Go away. Now.

(regarding the grocery bag) What d'you have here?
Vincent's mother grabs the top of the bag and begins to rummage through the
contents.

WOMAN
(disapproving) Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks. (accusing) What kind of a
sick woman brings this to a fifteen year old?

ELAINE
(sick smile) We have the same taste in movies.

WOMAN
Did he send you part of our VCR?
Elaine smiles and nods, and pulls at a chain she has round her neck. Threaded
onto the chain is the VCR button Vincent sent her.

ELAINE
Yeah.
Vincent's mother holds out her hand, and Elaine pulls the chain over her head
and hands it over.

WOMAN
(entering the apartment) Vincent!
Elaine reaches into the grocery bag and extracts the bottle of vodka. She
drops the rest of the bag on the floor, and strolls away, swinging the bottle
like a club.
[Tennis Club]
Jerry and Milos are still playing. Jerry is still throwing the game, and
Milos is still milking it. Jerry puts an easy return straight into the court
in front of himself.

MILOS
(pointing and shouting) Look at the big baby! (laughter) Hehaha. (to
Jerry) Hey, big baby, are you wetting yourself? Maybe it is time for you to
be changed. (laughter) Hahah.
Patty laughs too, with the few other spectators. Jerry looks angry at this
constant derision.

JERRY
(quietly) I told you to cut it out.
Jerry delivers a fierce serve which beats Milos, and almost hits him in the
face.

MILOS
(quietly, to Jerry) Hey, c'mon, what're you doing? (to his audience)
Huhuh. The baby got lucky on that one! Hahah.
Jerry walks back to deliver another serve. Kramer enters and looks around for
someone. On another court, Shellbach is facing an automatic serving machine.

KRAMER
(waving) Shellbach.
Shellbach waves vaguely back to Kramer, who has begun to walk round the room
to get to him.
Meanwhile, Jerry returns a shot to Milos, with some venom. Milos stretches
desperately to try and reach it, but loses his grip on his racquet. The
racquet arcs across the hall, watched by Patty, and then spotted by Kramer.

KRAMER
Racquet.
The racquet plummets from the air and strikes the guy who is operating the
automatic serving machine for Shellbach. The guy is knocked unconscious and,
as he falls, he pushes against the machine, turning it to point at Kramer.
Kramer stands transfixed, as it continues to launch balls at him. Several
balls in rapid succession strike him in the head, until he slumps,
unconscious, to the floor.

A boardroom very much like that of the Yankees, but with a Firestone sign on
the wall. Several people sit around the table, including Reilly, and George,
who is filling his face from a large dish of shrimp.

REILLY
So, George. You're proposing a snow tyre day at Yankee Stadium?

GEORGE
(through a mouthful) Long as they don't throw 'em on the field.
(laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought
enough for everybody.

MCADAM
(doubtful) I have to say this, this proposal doesn't make a whole lot
of sense.

GEORGE
Well, you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Let's see how many I can
fit in my mouth.
George begins picking up shrimp one by one and stuffing them into his mouth.

REILLY
(leaning forward) You know, George...
George looks up, expectantly.

REILLY
The ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.
Everyone around the table laughs. Except for George, who looks triumphant. He
swallows, and uses a napkin to clean his fingers.

GEORGE
(standing) Oh yeah, Reilly? (smugly) Well, the jerk store called.
They're running outta you

REILLY
(unperturbed) What's the difference? You're their all-time best
seller!
Reilly and everyone else laughs even more than they did before. George looks
angry and frustrated, even on the verge of tears for a second, then something
occurs to him.

GEORGE
Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife.
George looks round, smiling arrogantly, expecting laughter. But there is a
deep, uncomfortable, silence. Reilly, looks stony-faced. McAdam stands and
leans over to speak in George's ear.

MCADAM
His wife is in a coma.
George looks sick.
[Hospital Room]
Kramer lies in bed, asleep. Jerry sits in a chair, reading a newspaper.
There's a knock at the door and Elaine enters, carrying a VCR.

ELAINE
(to Jerry) Hi. (indicating Kramer) How's he doing?

JERRY
He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy.

ELAINE
Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got
him a Gene pick.

JERRY
What happened to Vincent?

ELAINE
(evasive) I'm kinda off of him. (looking around) Uh, outlet?
Jerry points to the wall beside Kramer's bed.

ELAINE
Ah.
Elaine walks over and sees both sockets are full. She takes hold of one of
the plugs and yanks it out of the socket with a grunt. The grunt wakes
Kramer, who looks groggily around and sees Elaine standing holding the plug,
as if she's just unplugged his life support. He stares, bug-eyed and shrieks
in terror.

KRAMER
(screaming) Waahhh!!!
[Insert]
A plane landing, with the caption 'NEW YORK, NEW YORK'.
[George's Car]
Once again, George drives along, frustrated and angry.

GEORGE
'My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called
and...
He tails off, as he can't think of anywhere to go. Then a look of
enlightenment comes to George's face, as he thinks of something.

GEORGE
(shouts) Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! (frustration)
D'ohh!
George looks gutted for a second, then a determined expression comes to his
face. He swings the car round with a squeal of tires, and heads back towards
the airport.

GEORGE
(cocky laughter) Huh haha! (shouts) You're meat, Reilly! You just
screwed yourself! (laughter) Ha ha!
End.

[SETTING
A Restaurant]

ELLEN
So, they have this clock now, where you punch in your age, and all your risk factors. It actually counts down how much time you have left to live.

JERRY
So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good!

ELLEN
(Laughs) I can't believe this is our first date.

JERRY
I know.. How about dessert?

ELLEN
I suppose I have to get a piece of cake..

JERRY
Why?

ELLEN
Today's my birthday.

JERRY
What? Today? Really?

ELLEN
Yeah.
(Waiters come out with a cake, singing "Happy Birthday" to a woman named "Lisa" at another table. Jerry ponders why Ellen isn't celebrating with her friends)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE
So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday?

JERRY
Yeah. And she picked the day!

GEORGE
Is she socially awkward?

JERRY
No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun..

GEORGE
Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.

JERRY
She's not Lincoln.
(Enter Kramer)

KRAMER
Hey! Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?

JERRY
I'll pass.

KRAMER
Oh, yeah? Huh. (Turns to George) Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, yum!

GEORGE
Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship.

JERRY
Does it ever bother you that this organization-

GEORGE
Nope!

JERRY
is beating the bushes-

GEORGE
Nope! (Starts heading for the door)

JERRY
to basically give this money away-

GEORGE
Noo!

JERRY
to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?

GEORGE
(Standing in the doorway) I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say! (Leaves)

STUDENT 1
And then I received a 740 on the English achievement test. (George looks bored)

GEORGE
Quick, what's your favorite animal?

STUDENT 1
I.. I don't know.. frog?

GEORGE
(Disappointed) A frog?

STUDENT 1
Well, I.. I..

GEORGE
(Annoyed) Frog is wrong.
(Cut to another student's interview)

GEORGE
(Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.

STUDENT 2
Well, the modern-day harp has been refined over thousands of years-

GEORGE
(Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.
(Cut to another student interview)

GEORGE
(Reading) I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.

STUDENT 3
(Smiling gloatingly) You like that, don't you?
(Cut to another student interview)

GEORGE
so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club.

STEVEN
State champs.

GEORGE
Who's your favorite chess player?

STEVEN
(Hesitating, he mumbles) Nastercoff?

GEORGE
Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?

STEVEN
(Sighs) I don't know.. I made it up. (Gets up to leave) I'm never gonna get this thing.

GEORGE
(Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. (They both sit back down)
What do you want to do when you grow up?

STEVEN
I've been telling people that I'd like to be an architect..
(George is suddenly interested)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Jerry's apartment]

ELAINE
So, get this: Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.

JERRY
Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it.
(Elaine mockingly laughs at Jerry's joke. Kramer enters)

KRAMER
Hey.

JERRY
Hey.

ELAINE
Hey!

KRAMER
Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto a pizza) and what-not.. mmm,
mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye. (Imitates the 'stink-eye') So I give hime the crook-eye back, (Imitates the 'crook-eye') you
know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys!

JERRY
The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?

KRAMER
Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom.
(demonstrates) I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop.

ELAINE
What? What happened?

KRAMER
Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing eight fingers.

JERRY
Well, what does that mean?

KRAMER
That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Outside a coffee shop]

ELLEN
(Sees a pay phone) Oh, Jerry, can you hold on a sec? I just want to check my messages.. (She meets up with two of her friends on the way to the phone)
Oh, Melissa! Kim!

MELISSA
Ellen.

ELLEN
Hey! You guys, I want you to meet Jerry. (Gestures tward Jerry, then goes back to the phone)

MELISSA
Ohh, we've heard a lot about you! (Confidentially) It is so sweet of you to take her out.

KIM
Yeah, you don't even know how much she needs this.

JERRY
(Sympathetically) She coming of a bad break-up?

KIM
(Casually) No.

MELISSA
See ya!
(They walk off. Ellen hangs up, then walks over to Jerry)

JERRY
Any messages?

ELLEN
Yeah, no one called.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Coffee shop]

JERRY
They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.

GEORGE
So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off)

JERRY
There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.

GEORGE
Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?

JERRY
No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!

GEORGE
(Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.

JERRY
Yeah?

GEORGE
I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V..

JERRY
Is he smart?

GEORGE
(Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this: he's into architecture.

JERRY
Hey! Just like you pretend to be.

GEORGE
Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.

JERRY
I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
J. Peterman's apartment]

ELAINE
Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality)

PETERMAN
Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop. (Sits in his recliner)

ELAINE
Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign
intrigue? Exotic romances?

PETERMAN
Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day life.

ELAINE
Oh.

PETERMAN
(Turns on the T.V, and starts flipping through the channels) Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally memorized them.

ELAINE
Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..

PETERMAN
(Still flipping through the channels) 2.. CBS..

ELAINE
get, um, started..

PETERMAN
3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview channel?

ELAINE
(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.

PETERMAN
well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?

ELAINE
You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?

PETERMAN
(Interested) You don't say.

ELAINE
Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.

PETERMAN
Well, that's pretty exciting. (Pause) Let's put that in the book.

ELAINE
But, that didn't happen to you.

PETERMAN
So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman.

ELAINE
No, I - I really don't think you can do that.

PETERMAN
(Looking at his dying plant) Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. (Starts looking through a small coupon box)

ELAINE
You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.

[SETTING
Coffee shop]
(Jerry's on a date with Ellen, he's desperately trying to find out what is wrong with her)

JERRY
Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?

ELLEN
No, this is brand new. Do you like it?

JERRY
Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!

ELLEN
(Laughs) No, Jerry, the waitress game be another one.

JERRY
I guess that's all right.

ELLEN
Is something wrong, Jerry?

JERRY
No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys!

GEORGE
Hey.

JERRY
(Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen.
(Kramer gives a look)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Susan Ross Foundation conference room]

GEORGE
Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve -
not showing off, not falling behind.

WYCK
George, the quailifications for this scholarship were suppose to be.. largely academic.

GEORGE
I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..

WYCK
These aren't standardized tests - these are his grades.

GEORGE
Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect.

WYCK
Is that right?

STEVEN
Actually, maybe I could set my sights a little bit higher.

GEORGE
(Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.

STEVEN
I think I'd really like to be a city planner. (Sits down, addressing the entire foundation board) Why limit myself to just one building, when I can design a
whole city?

WYCK
Well, that's a good point.

GEORGE
(Mutters) No, it's not.

STEVEN
Well, isn't an architect just an art school drop-out with a tilty desk, and a big ruler? (Laughs - so do the board members)

GEORGE
(Irritated) It's called a T-square.

WYCK
You know, the stupidest guy in my fraternity became an architect - after he flunked out of dental school! (Everyone but George laughs) Contratulations,
young man. (Shakes Steven's hand)

STEVEN
Thank you.

WYCK
Susan would be proud of what you're doing.

STEVEN
Thank you.

KRAMER
And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired.

PETERMAN
(Laughs) Kramer, my friend, that is one ripping good yarn.. (Hands Kramer a check)

KRAMER
You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his tongue)

ELAINE
No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -

PETERMAN
(Interrupting) How much would you take for the whole lot?

KRAMER
My whole lot?

PETERMAN
Name your price, man!

KRAMER
(Thinks) 1500 dollars.

PETERMAN
I'll give you half that.

KRAMER
(Excited) Done!

PETERMAN
Kramer, my friend, (Gestures to Elaine) consider Elaine at your disposal.

KRAMER
Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune)

[SETTING
Elaine's office]
(Elaine is growing weary of Kramer's childish antics. Kramer's practicing putting golf balls on her office floor)

ELAINE
Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!

KRAMER
Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.

ELAINE
What happened to Bob Saccamano?

KRAMER
Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer) So I'm waiting for the
subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.

ELAINE
Alright, well, now that's something..

KRAMER
Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew..

ELAINE
(Adding) A train is bearing down on you?!

KRAMER
No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.

ELAINE
(Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?

KRAMER
Well, I guess I was..

ELAINE
(Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back?

KRAMER
Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! (Pauses) All right, next story..

ELAINE
Alright, I think I got enough for one day.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah, chew on that.

ELAINE
(Mocking) Yeah, I'll chew on that.

KRAMER
Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn..

ELAINE
Oh, thanks. I've got plans.

KRAMER
Elaine, you should be there to document it.

ELAINE
(Putting on her coat) Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?

KRAMER
Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.

[SETTING

JERRY
So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?

GEORGE
I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my
father.. my father's father before him.

JERRY
You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings, he answers it) Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.

GEORGE
You're spending the weekend with Ellen?

JERRY
(To George, in a 'cha-ching!' motion) Vermont! (To Ellen) With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (George is
disturbed. He gets up, goes go Kramer's door, and knocks. They talk) Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye. (Hangs up. George and
Kramer come into Jerry's apartment, confronting him) What? (George takes the phone off the hook) What is this?

GEORGE
(To Kramer) You want to start?

KRAMER
(To George) Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.

GEORGE
Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.

JERRY
What?!

KRAMER
(Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that he's right on target)

JERRY
Where is this coming from? She's great!

GEORGE
(Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.

JERRY
There's nothing wrong with my career!

KRAMER
(Like a parent) Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.

GEORGE
I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!

KRAMER
Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.

GEORGE
Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!

KRAMER
Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated.

JERRY
(Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) I'm not buying any of this!

KRAMER
All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!

Hey, Kramer,

KRAMER
Yeah?

FRIEND 1
Ramirez has never heard your pants story.

KRAMER
Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I- (Elaine stops him)

ELAINE
You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.

KRAMER
What do ya mean?

ELAINE
You signed the release.

KRAMER
Yeah.

ELAINE
He sat in mud. Not you.

KRAMER
But I did sit in mud.

(Stern) Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!

KRAMER

Hey, now, they're tough cookies.

GEORGE
Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?

KRAMER
Uh.. ah, (Looks over at Elaine, and realizes he can't tell the Van Buren Boys story) Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's
what you're implying. (Laughs heartily)

GEORGE
(Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!

KRAMER
Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.

Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.

ELAINE
Yes! I'm a writer.

ELAINE
Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!

JERRY
Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.

ELAINE
What? Wheren't they just here?

JERRY
Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.

ELAINE
Maybe we could all have dinner later?

JERRY
I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.

KRAMER
Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch
next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! (Jerry and Elaine look disgusted)

JERRY
Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!

KRAMER
Damn!

JERRY
What?

KRAMER
Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!

[SETTING
Peterman's office]

ELAINE
Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?

PETERMAN
Well, it started out nicely: "I'm returning some pants." A very identifiable problem.. (turns page) "I set of down a train tunnel.".. (turns page) But that's
where the story takes a most unappealing turn.

ELAINE
Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a
whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!

PETERMAN
It just seems so cliched, and obvious. It's not interesting writing.

ELAINE
Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your
pants?

PETERMAN
(Intrigued) The very pants I was returning. That's perfect irony! Elaine, that is interesting writing! (The intercom beeps)

SECRETARY
I have a Cosmo Kramer on line 4.

PETERMAN
(Picks up the phone) Peterman, here.

KRAMER
Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!

PETERMAN
You want to know something? I no longer need them!

ELAINE
No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?

PETERMAN
Nonsense! (To Kramer) I have Benes' woderfully imaginative mind to spin my stories. You take back your tales, you vagabond!

KRAMER
Yippie-yi-yay!

PETERMAN
(Hangs up) There you are, Elaine. Go forth, and create. (Elaine gets up to leave) And, by the way, when you get to that chapter about my romantic
escapades - feel free to toss yourself in the mix.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
NYC Street]
(George meets up with the Van Buren Boys again)

GEORGE
Hey, Van B. Boys.

STEVEN
So, Mister Costanza, did you get my scholarship back?

GEORGE
Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own.

MEMBER 2
Is that right? Then why don't you flash us the sign?

GEORGE
Right.. the sign. (Hesitates, then makes a series of stupid gestures)

STEVEN
That's not the sign.

GEORGE
(Defensively loud) It was when I was banging!

MEMBER 2
All right, if you really are one of us.. let's see you take the wallet off the next guy who walks by.

GEORGE
Love to! (Cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Coffee shop]

ELLEN
And after college, I got my masters at the Sorbonne.

MORTY
Sorbonne? Oh, hey. (To Helen) That's in Paris.

ELLEN
(Looks at her watch) Oh, Jerry, you're parking meter's about to expire. Don't get up, I've got change. (Leaves with her purse)

JERRY
(To his parents) So? What do you think?

HELEN
Jerry, she's fantastic.

JERRY
I knew it! I'm not crazy.

HELEN
She's so sweet, and she's got some body on her!

MORTY
And smart! Like a computer!

HELEN
And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we think. Do you like her?

JERRY
(After seeing how much his parents like her) Now, I'm not so sure.

HELEN
Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that you were with.

JERRY
yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas..
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
NYC Alley]

MEMBER 2
The next one, or you're meat!

GEORGE
Alright, alright! (Goes out onto the sidewalk. The Seinfelds walk by) Seinfelds!

MORTY
Hey, George!

GEORGE
Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later.

MORTY
How're your folks?

GEORGE
Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your
guts right here on the street!

MORTY
What did you say?

GEORGE
Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!

HELEN
You're being very rude. Come on, Morty.

GEORGE
(Pleading) Please, please, they're gonna hit me! (Attempts to grab Helen's purse, she starts hitting George defensively, he backs off)

MORTY
Tell your parents we said 'Hi!' (They leave)
(The Van Buren Boys come out of the alley, George holds up his hand in a "stop" gesture - then takes off running down the street, screaming. The Van Buren Boys
chase him)
End.

[JENNA'S APARTMENT
Bathroom]
Jerry is standing by the sink, preparing to brush his teeth. Jenna (his latest
ladyfriend) enters.

JENNA
Morning.

JERRY
Morning.
She hands him a tube of toothpaste.

JENNA
Hope you don't mind baking soda flavour.

JERRY
(applying paste to brush) Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I
can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?

JENNA
I'm gonna grab you a towel.
Jenna leaves the bathroom. Jerry brushes his teeth. He clearly doesn't like the
taste of the baking soda, and leans over the sink to spit. He puts his hand on
the counter and knocks Jenna's toothbrush off the edge. The brush falls into the
toilet bowl.
There is a shot from beneath the water in the toilet, looking up. Jerry's face
looking down into the bowl, with an expression of shock and horror.
Jerry looks behind him, to see if Jenna has spotted him. He rolls up the sleeve
of his dressing gown, grimaces, and plunges his hand into the toilet. He grabs
the brush out, drops it on a shelf beside the mirror and immediately begins
frantically washing his hands. As he completes this task, he raises his head and
finds Jenna has returned. She is standing behind him, smiling as she brushes her
teeth with the brush he just retrieved from the toilet.

JERRY
Ooh-ooh
[Monk's]
Jerry and George in a booth, as per usual.

GEORGE
So?

JERRY
So? She used the toothbrush!

GEORGE
You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?

JERRY
Yeah.

GEORGE
So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the
time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it
out.

JERRY
How many years of med school did you have?

GEORGE
Was she mad?
Jerry says nothing, but pulls a face.

GEORGE
You didn't tell her.

JERRY
Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word)

GEORGE
Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?

JERRY
I'll take fastidious.
George puts his keys on the table. On the ring is a miniature head, clearly a
caricature of someone.

JERRY
What is that?

GEORGE
Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being
inducted into the Hall of Fame.
He squeezes the miniature head.

HEAD
Holy cow!

JERRY
They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy
cow', do they?

GEORGE
Just the last few innings of a double-header.
Kramer enters. He is carrying a battered sewing machine. He comes over.

KRAMER
Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt
expressway, going seventy and (makes impact sound - pckergh!) Dragged this thing
for five exits.
He dumps the machine on the table and sits beside Jerry.

JERRY
Why didn't you pull over?

KRAMER
Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The
infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.
George squeezes the miniature head.

HEAD
Holy cow!

KRAMER
Well, look at that. A talking Nixon.
[Elaine's Apartment/Chinese Restaurant]
Elaine is calling for Chinese food. The scene flicks from her at home with the
phone and a menu, to the restaurant owner taking the order.

OWNER
China Panda.

ELAINE
Yeah, I'd like to place an order.

OWNER
Ah yes, what you like?

ELAINE
This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that
true?

OWNER
What number?

ELAINE
Forty-seven.

OWNER
Yeah, first time. What else?

ELAINE
Uh, that's it.

OWNER
Address?

ELAINE
Seventy-eight, West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E.

OWNER
That's southside. Sorry, we don't deliver below Eighty-sixth.

ELAINE
I'm not below.

OWNER
Yes you are. Street itself is boundary.

ELAINE
Your guy can't cross to my side?

OWNER
If we deliver to you, then what? Eighty-fifth Street, Wall Street,
Mexico, Eighty-fourth Street.

ELAINE
Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.

OWNER
Sorry, food only for those who live within boundary. (slams down phone)
Elaine listens to the dial tone for a second. Then she pushes the redial.

OWNER
(picks up phone) China Panda.

ELAINE
(using silly voice) Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.

OWNER
Ah, what you like?
[Jerry's Apartment]
Kramer enters. He's smoking a substantial cigar.

KRAMER
Well, I'm a poppa.

JERRY
Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.

KRAMER
(handing Jerry a cigar) Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a
one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.

JERRY
Oh, that adopt-a-highway thing.

KRAMER
Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I
checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.
He gets his wallet from his back pocket and shows Jerry a Polaroid snapshot in
it.

JERRY
Aw, looks just like you.

KRAMER
Aw, I'm beaming Jerry.

JERRY
So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?

KRAMER
They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their
so-called maintenance equipment.

JERRY
That old scam.

KRAMER
Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't
about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.

JERRY
At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.

KRAMER
Quality time.
George enters looking anxious, maybe borderline panicky. He stalks about the
place, looking for something, frustratedly.

GEORGE
Keys. I can't find my keys.

JERRY
You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!

GEORGE
Have you seen 'em?

JERRY
No.

GEORGE
Dammit!

KRAMER
C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?

GEORGE
I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.

KRAMER
Right.

JERRY
Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.

GEORGE
I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.

JERRY
So?

GEORGE
So you can't duplicate 'em.
At this, Jerry and Kramer exchange a look, and laugh.

KRAMER
Sure you can. (to Jerry) Such a sweet kid.
[Street]
Elaine stands on the sidewalk, waiting for someone. She looks up the street and
sees a Chinese delivery boy approaching with a bag of food. She ducks into the
entranceway to the apartment building behind her, and then effects to be coming
out of the building as the delivery boy gets there.

ELAINE
Oh. Oh, hi. China Panda?

DELIVERY BOY
(suspicious) Why you waiting on the street and not in your
apartment?

ELAINE
I... thought that I would meet you halfway.
She takes the bag of food.

DELIVERY BOY
You really live here?

ELAINE
Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now.
I'll see you.
Elaine walks back towards the door to the building. She expects the boy to
leave, but he's still suspicious, and waits. Elaine tries the door, but it's
locked. She looks, and the boy still waits. Elaine tries the door harder, but it
won't yield. She admits defeat and hands the food back, and receives her money.
The delivery boy walks off.

ELAINE
(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!
[Another Street]
George is standing outside a store, looking preoccupied. Jerry emerges from the
store with a carrier bag full of stuff.

JERRY
Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.

GEORGE
So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?
They begin to walk along the street.

JERRY
By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is
it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?

GEORGE
No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt
like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should
really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well,
they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while,
twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up
to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The
broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!
George dashes off excitedly. Jerry follows, with somewhat less enthusiasm.
[Eighty-sixth Street]
George is still animatedly leading Jerry along in pursuit of his keys.

GEORGE
Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling
sound.

JERRY
You didn't look down?

GEORGE
I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around
here.
He peers about at the road surface for the pothole. He finds a patch of fresh
tarmac.

GEORGE
No! No!!
A car drives by, running right over the patch.

HEAD (O.C.)
Holy, Holy Cow!

JERRY
Poor son of a bitch.
[Jenna's Apartment]
Jenna is at the sink in her bathroom, using an electric toothbrush which Jerry
has bought her. It's loud.

JERRY
It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one
they make.

JENNA
It's like I'm holding a blender.

JERRY
The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.
Jerry begins to wander into the living room. Jenna switches off the brush.

JERRY
Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.

JENNA
(restarting and reapplying the brush) Really, it does?

JERRY
(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out.

JENNA
(shouting to Jerry) I was really happy with my old toothbrush.
In the living room, Jerry is carefully putting the old brush into a plastic bag,
being very careful not to touch it with his bare skin. He then seals the bag.

JERRY
No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use
the Plax too.
Jenna takes a sip from a glass as if to gargle.

JENNA (O.C.)
That stuff tastes like bleach!
Jerry is looking for a place to put the soiled brush.

JERRY
I don't know anything about that.
Just before Jenna emerges from the bathroom, Jerry throws the bag with the brush
out of the window.

JENNA
Mmm. My mouth feels so clean.

JERRY
That's the idea.
Jenna approaches Jerry, clearly intending to kiss him. As Jenna leans toward
him, Jerry gets a flashback of the toothbrush plunging into the toilet bowl, in
black and white, with portentous music. From his viewpoint, we see Jenna's lips
looming toward him. He looks nauseated by the prospect of the kiss, and pulls
away.

JERRY
You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I
don't wanna give you any of my germs.

JENNA
Aww. Okay. Thanks, I guess.
[Jerry's Car]
Jerry driving with Elaine in the passenger seat.

ELAINE
You still couldn't kiss her?

JERRY
She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.

ELAINE
Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.

JERRY
Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get
inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something
there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.

ELAINE
Jer, do you see where this is going?

JERRY
Being really clean and happy?

ELAINE
Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just
tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking
disorder.

JERRY
Disorder?

ELAINE
And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.

JERRY
(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there
it is.
We see Jerry and Elaine's view of the road signs. 'Mile 114' 'Adopt-a-Highway'
and 'Litter removal next 1 Mile KRAMER'.

ELAINE
Shall we stop and say hi?

JERRY
Nah, we've seen it.

ELAINE
Yeah.
[Mile 114]
Kramer is standing on the verge beside a large pile of plastic bags full of
trash, a couple of brooms lean against the crash barrier. He has an armful of
assorted garbage. Jerry's car passes in the traffic, and a brief beep of the
horn is heard.

KRAMER
(shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!
He drops the last handful of trash into a bag.

KRAMER
Mile one-fourteen, clean as a whistle.
He claps his hands in satisfaction, and looks out at 'his' road. He notices
something. In the middle of the road is a Coke can, crushed by traffic.
Kramer makes a decision, and dashes out into the traffic to retrieve the can.
His progress to the can is accompanied by the squeal of brakes and the blare of
horns as the traffic passes him. As he reaches the can, one car has to come to a
complete stop. Kramer grabs the can and hurries back to the side of the road,
where he leans on the barrier.
[Apartment Building]
Elaine is in the hallway of a building, outside Apartment 1A. She knocks at the
door and a guy opens it.

MAN
Yeah?

ELAINE
Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh,
(coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I
could use your apartment to order some food?

MAN
Wha? What d'you want?

ELAINE
You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my
side of the street.

MAN
Wh, when is that?

ELAINE
No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is
all.

MAN
Who are you with?

ELAINE
No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.

MAN
Who let you in?

ELAINE
Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I
just need like a half an hour to an hour.
The man shuts the door in her face.
Elaine turns to leave, and as she does she sees an unmarked door opposite which
stands open. She crosses over for a closer look. It's clearly a janitor's
closet, with the usual fixings. A thought occurs to Elaine, and a smile comes to
her face.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry has just entered and is removing his coat. Kramer is in the kitchen
cleaning highway signs in the sink.

JERRY
What's with the signs?

KRAMER
Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean
the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes
sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods.

JERRY
Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.

KRAMER
(holding up a sign) Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per
hour. See? They slipped a one in there. (laughing) Those kids with the spray
paint, God love 'em.
George enters.

JERRY
Hey. So, keys?

GEORGE
No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really
a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.

JERRY
I guess they leave that up to the general population.

GEORGE
I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't
be happening!

JERRY
Hard to say.

KRAMER
Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today
on the highway, they could probably help you out.

GEORGE
Really?

KRAMER
Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my
car-pool lane.
The buzzer buzzes.

JERRY
Yeah?

JENNA (O.C.)
It's Jenna.
Jerry buzzes Jenna in, opens the door and indicates to George and Kramer that
their presence is no longer required.

JERRY
If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
George and Kramer leave, still discussing the maintenance guys.

GEORGE
You think you could hook me up with these guys?

KRAMER
Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency
callbox seven-eight-four.

GEORGE
Seven-eight-four.
Jenna enters.

JENNA
Hey.

JERRY
Hi.

JENNA
How you feeling?

JERRY
Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you,
which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.
Jenna moves in for the kiss. As she leans towards Jerry, he gets that revolted
look on his again and turns his face away.

JENNA
What?!

JERRY
Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I
brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly)
and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you
before you could use it.

JENNA
What?

JERRY
I'm sorry.

JENNA
When were you gonna tell me this?!

JERRY
Obviously never.
The door opens and Kramer enters.

KRAMER
I need the yield sign.
Kramer goes and begins to gather the signs from the kitchen.

JERRY
Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs
out of here, please?
Kramer brings his signs from the kitchen and Jerry picks up those which were on
his table. Together they carry them across the hall to Kramer's apartment.

KRAMER
You could've introduced me.

JERRY
I wouldn't know where to start.
As Jerry is about to return to his apartment, the door is slammed shut. He tries
to open it, but it has been locked.

JERRY
(knocking) Hey, Jenna. Hey!
Jenna opens the door, she has her jacket in her hand and is ready to leave.

JENNA
There. Now something of yours has been in the toilet.

JERRY
What?! Wha... what'd you put in there?

JENNA
Gotta run.
Jenna departs, leaving Jerry looking around him. He's wide-eyed, looking panicky
and disgusted.

JERRY
Oh, man!
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is on the phone. His table is covered with bottles of cleaning fluids,
disinfectants, etc.. He is wearing a rubber glove to hold a spatula. Elaine is
eating an apple and watching him.

JERRY
(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula?
Hello? Dammit!
Frustrated, he throws the spatula into the waste bin.

ELAINE
She won't even give you a hint?

JERRY
No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.

ELAINE
You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote.

JERRY
Yes, that is a definite possibility.
He picks up the remote control and drops it into a waste bin.

ELAINE
(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there.
Jerry picks up the walkman and begins to deposit it in the trash, then a thought
occurs to him. Elaine sits on the couch and picks up the phone.

JERRY
Are you just screwing with me?

ELAINE
Yeah, I am.
Jerry thinks for a second, then he throws the walkman in the garbage anyway.
Kramer enters carrying a box.

KRAMER
Hey ah.

JERRY
Hey, how's life on the road?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry.

JERRY
I don't doubt it.
Kramer puts his box on the kitchen counter.

KRAMER
You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look
quick, but they're there.
From the box, Kramer picks up square orange reflective objects.

JERRY
What's this?

KRAMER
Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes
noise - bum, bum, bum, bum, bump)

JERRY
Isn't that some kind of safety thing?

KRAMER
Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.

JERRY
What the hell are you talking about?

KRAMER
Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better
ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.
Elaine has the receiver from the phone held to her ear.

ELAINE
How are you gonna widen the lanes?

KRAMER
Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway
becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to Jerry) So, you got any black paint?

JERRY
(sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.

ELAINE
(into phone) Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number
forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.

JERRY
One-Q? Whose apartment is that?

ELAINE
That's the janitor closet, across the street.

JERRY
You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this
flounder?

ELAINE
It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.
Kramer is applying something from Jerry's table of cleaning fluids, etc, to his
neck, like a cologne.

KRAMER
That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.

ELAINE
(heading to door) How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery
zone.

KRAMER
Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the
weekends.

ELAINE
Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.
Elaine leaves.

KRAMER
Now, where's that tool shed of yours?
[Apartment Building]
The delivery boy from China Panda in the hallway. He knocks at the door to the
janitor's closet. He looks at the label on the door, which is a piece of tape
with '1Q' crudely written in magic marker. He waits for a couple of seconds then
knocks again. Elaine opens the door, with a towel wrapped around her head, as if
her hair is wet.

ELAINE
Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.
She takes the bag with her order and hands over some money. The delivery boy is
trying to see past her into the 'apartment'.

ELAINE
I'll see you.
She shuts the door, leaving the delivery boy looking a tad bemused.
[Eighty-sixth Street]
George stands by the filled pothole. A highway maintenance truck is parked next
to it. A trio of workers approach George, and the senior man speaks.

RALPH
You Costanza?

GEORGE
Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys,
buried in the pothole.

RALPH
What're the keys doing in there?

GEORGE
Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.

RALPH
You put 'em in there?

GEORGE
Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.

RALPH
Bad place to put your keys.

GEORGE
Yeah, I know that. (clears throat) Could you start, working?

RALPH
Difficult job. You want those keys, we're gonna have to dig this up.

GEORGE
(penny drops) Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. (snorts) Is this
about money?

RALPH
Yeah. (snorts) It's about money.
[Mile 114]
Kramer is driving his car slowly along the Expressway. On either side of his
boot is balanced an orange road cone. The traffic is passing him, and the blare
of horns is regularly heard.
Kramer opens the driver side door. He picks up a paint roller, and loads it with
black paint from a tray on the passenger seat. Then he leans out of the door and
rolls the paint over the lane markers, still steering the car with his other
hand.
[Apartment Building]
Elaine emerges from the janitor's closet. She's wiping her lips, following the
flounder repast. As she does so, a woman walking along the hall notices her.

MRS ALLISTER
'Scuse me, what are you doing in there?

ELAINE
Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.

MRS ALLISTER
You were hanging around in there, lazing on the job. When you
shoulda been downstairs in the basement, cleaning out those old carpets and
scrap wood.

ELAINE
Right, because... I'm the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail)

MRS ALLISTER
Don't get smart with me.

ELAINE
(meek) Yes ma'am.
[Kramer's Apartment]
Kramer is in bed. His alarm goes off, and the radio comes on in the middle of
the traffic report. Kramer wakes up and listens.

RADIO
Hey, and if you're heading north on the Arthur Berkhardt, whoah Nelly,
for some reason four lanes are converging into two, instantaneously right at
mile-marker one-fourteen. I don't know what that is, but the A-B's a parking lot
out there. Somebody screwed up on that one.
By the end of the report, Kramer looks slightly worried.
[Janitor's Closet]
Elaine stands waiting in the closet. There's the usual paraphernalia - buckets,
brooms, cleaning materials, stepladder, boxes, etc.. There's a knock at the
door. Elaine opens it to find Jerry.

ELAINE
Oh it's you.

JERRY
Is the flounder here yet?

ELAINE
No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?
Jerry enters, and Elaine closes the door.

ELAINE
(gesturing) There's this.

JERRY
Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a
slop-bucket.
There's another knock at the door.

ELAINE
(gleeful) The fish!
She opens the door to find George. He's wearing a tartan workshirt.

ELAINE
Ah, what're you doing here?

GEORGE
Hey.

JERRY
Hey.
George joins Jerry and Elaine in the closet. It's getting a bit cramped.

GEORGE
Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd
drop by.

JERRY
Kramer's guys?

GEORGE
Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the
jackhammering myself.

JERRY
Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
The door is pushed open from the outside. It thumps into George who is pushed
into Elaine, who stumbles into Jerry.

GEORGE
Ow!

ELAINE
Uh, man!
Kramer enters the now crowded closet.

KRAMER
Huh, yeah. (looks round) Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint
thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.

ELAINE
I'm plumb out.

KRAMER
Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I
don't wanna lose my baby!
There's yet another knock at the door. More strident.

MRS ALLISTER (O.C.)
Janitor?

ELAINE
(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs
Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out.
Elaine struggle to squeeze past George, and then Kramer to reach the door. The
she has to make room to swing the door inwards.

ELAINE
Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.
She succeeds in squeezing out, and stumbles into the hallway. The crush behind
her slams the door shut.

ELAINE
Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?

MRS ALLISTER
I told you yesterday to haul that trash outta the basement.

ELAINE
Yeah, I am so sorry.

MRS ALLISTER
Some of the children have been playing near it and putting it in
their mouths.

ELAINE
Well, a lot of it is vegetable...
In the closet, the guys are struggling together with equipment and supplies in
the cramped space. The thumps of their movements can be heard in the hallway.

MRS ALLISTER
Get that stuff outta there today, or you'll be outta here.
Understand?

ELAINE
(meekly) Yes ma'am.
The janitor's closet door opens and the guys stumble out.

GEORGE
...stop pushing. (to Elaine) Kramer spilled ammonia.

JERRY
I don't feel like eating.

KRAMER
(holding up a set of heavy chains) I'm gonna borrow this, huh?

ELAINE
(to Mrs Allister) Janitor's meeting.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jenna enters and sits, Jerry closes the door behind her. It is clear that Jerry
has gone overboard in his efforts to dispose of whatever was contaminated - his
kitchen shelves are bare, and most other surfaces are free of the usual
knick-knacks.

JENNA
So Jerry, why'd you call me?

JERRY
Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know
now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?

JENNA
Yes, I did.

JERRY
Well, whatever. So, how've you been?

JENNA
Good.

JERRY
Good. (pause) Steak knife?

JENNA
Just eating away at you isn't it?

JERRY
Nah.
The door opens and Elaine enters.

ELAINE
Hi.

JENNA
Hi.

JERRY
Hi.

ELAINE
Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?

JERRY
For what?

ELAINE
I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.

JERRY
Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong
with dirt.

ELAINE
Well, actually it's pretty grimy.

JERRY
Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and
put it right on my leather upholstery.
He hands the keys to Elaine.

ELAINE
Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.

JERRY
Sure. Bye.

ELAINE
Bye.

JENNA
Bye.

ELAINE
Bye.
Elaine leaves.

JERRY
There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all
sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free
sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is
it? What is it?!

JENNA
Toilet brush.

JERRY
Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I
can replace that.

JENNA
You wanna order dinner?

JERRY
Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
[Eighty-sixth Street]
Elaine strides along the sidewalk looking very blue-collar in overalls and cap,
grimy face, etc. She has some old carpet slung over one shoulder and some paint
cans in her hand. A jackhammer can be heard. As she walks along, she passes
George who is holding the jackhammer. She nods acknowledgment and he touches the
peak of his hardhat. George gives the pothole a burst from the jackhammer.
[Street]
Kramer struggles to lift a forty-gallon drum into the boot of his car. He
eventually heaves it in.
[Jenna's Apartment]
Jerry and Jenna, sitting on the couch, eating and conversing (looks like Chinese
food).

JERRY
That's true.

JENNA
Mm.

JERRY
But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic
mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting
relationship.
[Eighty-sixth Street]
George is giving the street a long burst from the jackhammer. Suddenly, there is
a clang. George stops hammering, and listens. There is a deep rumbling sound,
from beneath his feet, which seems to be getting louder. He looks around for the
source of the noise.
[Jenna's Apartment]
Jenna and Jerry are still eating on the couch. The rumbling noise can be heard,
though not so loud as outside. Then, in the bathroom, the toilet starts to
rattle.

JENNA
Do you hear something?
They both listen intently. The rumble continues and, in the bathroom, the toilet
rattles again, the cistern shaking.

JERRY
I don't know what that could be.
Jenna gets up and goes to the bathroom door.
[Eighty-sixth Street]
There is a rending sound, and a huge jet of water erupts from the ground right
in front of George, where he was hammering. There is a shot from above the
rising column of water. On the top rises George's keyring.

HEAD
Holy cow!
The plume of water rises high above George, who can be seen looking up at the
height of it.
[Jenna's Apartment]
In the bathroom, Jenna is peering curiously at her rattling toilet, wondering
what's wrong. She leans toward the bowl. Jerry is in the living room, still
talking to her.

JERRY
Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty,
whatever.
There is the sound of a wet explosion and splashing water, followed by Jenna
screaming in the bathroom. Jerry leaps to his feet and rushes to see what has
happened.
Jerry enters the bathroom and sees Jenna. Only her forearm is visible to us, but
it's enough for us to know that she is wringing wet as the result of a violent
eruption from the toilet bowl.
Jerry's face registers his obvious distaste. He shrugs, sorry.

JERRY
Holy cow! Have a nice life.
He closes the bathroom door as he leaves.
[Jerry's Car]
Elaine driving. The passenger seats are piled with the garbage from the basement
- old carpets, bits of timber, boxes, etc. An external shot of the car reveals
she is driving on Kramer's section of road, as the black-painted lane markers
can be seen.

ELAINE
Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.
We see the Saab weave across the extra wide lanes. From the boot falls a
battered sewing machine. It sits in the middle of the carriageway.
[Arthur Berkhardt Expressway]
Kramer is manhandling the forty gallon drum out of his boot. He struggles to
heave it clear, and then he drops it. The drum falls onto its side, and the lid
comes off, spilling the contents across the road.

KRAMER
Bugger!
[Newman's Truck]
Newman is singing as he drives. Beside him are a stack of boxes, marked 'Fresh
Fish'.

NEWMAN
(sings) You're once. Twice. Three times a lady.
There's a loud crash as the truck runs over the sewing machine. Tyres squeal as
Newman regains control.

NEWMAN
What the hell was that?
The truck is travelling along with the sewing machine caught on the front axle.
As it scrapes along the road, it leaves a huge trail of sparks behind.
[Arthur Berkhardt Expressway]
Kramer rights the empty drum and does a double-take as he notices the warning
labels on the side - 'Paint Thinner' 'Highly Flammable'.

KRAMER
Double bugger!
[Newman's Truck]
Newman still singing, although the grinding sound of the sewing machine is
almost drowning out his voice. The sewing machine is still producing a shower of
sparks under the truck.

NEWMAN
(sings) Yes, you're once. Twice. Three times...
Suddenly, the truck clearly reaches the pool of thinner and the sparks ignite
it. Flames shoot up around the truck, and are reflected in the windows. Newman
begins screaming and yelling in the midst of the inferno.

NEWMAN
Aaah! Aaagh! Aah-aah. Oh, oh the humanity! Aaagh!
[Arthur Berkhardt Expressway]
Kramer finally manages to get the drum back into his boot and slams the lid
down. Then he sees Newman staggering along the road. Newman is walking stiffly,
and is singed all over, with blackened patches on his hair and clothing. He's
staring ahead, clearly in such a state of shock that he's uncomprehending of his
surroundings.

KRAMER
Hey buddy. What're you doing out here?
Newman continues to walk, oblivious of Kramer.

KRAMER
Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.
Newman still doesn't respond. In the distance the sound of sirens can be heard.
Kramer hears them, looks worried, and moves toward the car.

KRAMER
Hey, I gotta skedaddle. You wanna lift?
Kramer has the driver's door open and is impatient to be off. The sirens
continue.

KRAMER
Newman! Newman!!
Kramer gets in the car and leans out of the window to call to Newman.

KRAMER
Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
He starts the car, and leaves with a squeal of protesting tyres. Newman
continues his walk.
As the Castle Rock logo comes up, Newman can be heard screaming 'Aargh!'.
End.

[SETTING
Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry's sitting at the table, reading the paper. George bursts into the room)

GEORGE
Jerry! (Slams the door) Georgie's moving out!

JERRY
(Gets up) Get out!

GEORGE
I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.

JERRY
(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?

GEORGE
(Definite) Oh yeah.

JERRY
So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?

GEORGE
You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)

JERRY
She's out.

GEORGE
(Stops) Oh right, the blind date.

JERRY
Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.

GEORGE
Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.

JERRY
I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.

GEORGE
(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)

JERRY
(Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.

GEORGE
(Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Manhattan Mini-storage]
(Jerry and Kramer both go up to a unit door. Kramer's pulling a wagon full of junk. He starts to cough uncontrollably)

JERRY
(Disgusted) What is with that?!

KRAMER
Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air)

JERRY
(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?

KRAMER
Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.

JERRY
You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.

KRAMER
Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again)
(Jerry opens the door, mail bags start spilling out of the unit)

JERRY
(Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?

KRAMER
(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
George's new apartment]
(George is moving in. The place is bare. A woman walks in while he's attempting to hang a lamp near the fire place)

RICARDI
Excuse me, George?

GEORGE
(Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off)

RICARDI
(Moves into the apartment, hand out) No, I'm Mrs. Ricardi - president of the tenant's association.

GEORGE
Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball
tward Mrs. Ricadi. She backs off defensively) Come on! (Stops and laughs right before running into her)

RICARDI
No, no.. (Laughs nervously) Uh, George, unfortunately, Clarance Eldridge in 8C has decided that he wants the apartment.

GEORGE
(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.

RICARDI
Yes, but, you see - Mister Eldridge is an Andrea Doria survivor. And, in light of the terrible suffering that he's already been through, we've decided to
give it to him.

GEORGE
(Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)

RICARDI
(Correcting) Shipwreck.

GEORGE
I remember.. (Leaves)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Restaurant]
(Elaine is sitting alone, waiting for her date - Alan. She's thinking to herself)

ELAINE
Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) "Cancer in labratory animals"..
huh.
(A waiter approaches)

WAITER
Excuse me, Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah?

WAITER
An Alan Mercer called for you. He said he's sorry, but he won't be able to make it tonight. (Pause) He's been stabbed.

ELAINE
(Shocked) Stabbed?!

WAITER
More bread?
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Jerry's apartment]

JERRY
(Talking to Elaine) You ate more bread?

ELAINE
That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!

JERRY
Did you find out who stabbed him?

ELAINE
Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.

JERRY
(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.

ELAINE
Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned
on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.

JERRY
(Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
(Kramer enters)

KRAMER
(Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the kitchen)

JERRY AND ELAINE
Hey.

KRAMER
Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food)

JERRY
There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.

KRAMER
(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so
Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy.

JERRY
(In awe. Whispering) The botched it?

KRAMER
(Complaining) I'm even more potent now!
(Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face. George enters)

GEORGE
Hey.

JERRY
Hey. How's the new place?!

GEORGE
Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it
to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..

ELAINE
Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?

JERRY
(Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald.

ELIANE
I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.

JERRY
(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.

GEORGE
(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..

ELAINE
I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.

JERRY
(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.

KRAMER
(Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his
tongue)
(Everyone's taken back by Kramer's knowledge)

GEORGE
How do you know?

KRAMER
it's in my book - "Astonishing Tales of the Sea" 51 people died.

GEORGE
51 people?!

KRAMER
That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!

KRAMER
There were 1,650 survivors.

GEORGE
That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door.
Kramer grabs his food, and follows)

KRAMER
Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear Attacks"
(George opens the door, and enters Kramer's apartment. Jerry stops Kramer before he can do the same)

JERRY
Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?

KRAMER
Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. (Leaves)
(Jerry nods his head - like it was expected)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Newman's apartment]
(Jerry knocks on the door as it opens slowly. Newman's sitting on the couch, watching TV in a state of depression)

JERRY
Newman?

NEWMAN
(Eyes glued to the TV) I guess.

JERRY
Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.

NEWMAN
Sometimes we don't get what we want.

JERRY
(Confused) What are you talking about?

NEWMAN
I didn't get my transfer.

JERRY
"Transfer"?

NEWMAN
To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm
hanging it up.

JERRY
You quit the post office?

NEWMAN
Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm just not delivering mail.

JERRY
Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.

NEWMAN
And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.

JERRY
(Cheerfully) Well, a law's a law. (Leaves)

[SETTING
Central Park]

Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?

MAN
What cough?
(One of his dogs, Smuckers, coughs. Kramer reacts while pointing to the dog)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Restaurant]
(Elaine's on a date with Alan)

ELAINE
I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures.
Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down)

ALAN
No, it's okay. I'm.. still just a little bit jumpy.

ELAINE
(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?

ALAN
Just.. one of those things, you know.

ELAINE
What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?

ALAN
I don't know. Could be.
(A woman, Carol, passes. She stops infront of Elaine and Alan's table)

CAROL
Alan?!

ALAN
Carol?
(Carol grabs his hot coffee, and throws it in his face, then storms off. Alan screams from the pain)

ELAINE
(Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!

ALAN
(Between screams) No, that was a different girl.

[SETTING
Coffee shop]

JERRY
There was another crazed ex-girlfriend?

ELAINE
Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.

JERRY
Mmm.. Bad how?

ELAINE
(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.

JERRY
(Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?

ELAINE
Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.

JERRY
(Agreeing) What's more important?

What's with the dog?

KRAMER
(Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)

GEORGE
Oh..
(Smuckers coughs)

KRAMER
(Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.

GEORGE
A vet?

KRAMER
Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops
snapping) - all on the same day.

GEORGE
So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?

Yes, it was a terrifying ordeal.

GEORGE
I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? (Laughs)

ELDRIDGE
(Defensively) We had to abandon ship.

GEORGE
Well, all vacations have to end eventually.

ELDRIDGE
The boat sank.

GEORGE
(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So,
uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?

ELDRIDGE
Is that what this is all about?! I don't think I like you. (Enters his apartment, and slams the door behind him)

worse - he has a nagging cough. (Smucker's coughs) Yeah, that's it. That's it.

Yeah, well, uh - we've been seeing a lot of this lately. Been drinking from the toilet?

been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!

JERRY
You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza".

GEORGE
(Interested) I should!

JERRY
I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.

GEORGE
I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!

JERRY

George going) So, you want a protein shake, or something?

Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves)

JERRY
(Angered) Hello.. Newman.

NEWMAN
(Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!

JERRY
What's the difference?

NEWMAN
The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!

JERRY
Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.

NEWMAN
Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be
stuck in this apartment building forever! (Lays down on Jerry's couch) The dream is dead.

JERRY
You're giving up that easy?

NEWMAN
I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya.

JERRY

play with my toys.

ELAINE
Well, anyway, get this: I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me "big head".

JERRY
"Big head" (Scoffs) That's almost a compliment.

Hey, George.

Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.

JERRY
You can't make it?

GEORGE
Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.

JERRY
Alright. (Hangs up)

ELAINE
Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?

JERRY
(Saddened) Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.

Kramer's coughs, then walks off)

JERRY
Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible.

JERRY
(Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.

KRAMER
(Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too tender.

JERRY
Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog)

C'mon. Just sit down!

(Squirming) Jerry! What?!

JERRY
Sit down! Sit down!

KRAMER
(Struggling) Hey!

JERRY
Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!
(Jerry forces the pill into Kramer's mouth, then holds Kramer's mouth shut for a few moments. Thinking Kramer's already swallowed it, he lets go. Instantly, Kramer
spits the pill out into the air. Jerry sighs, giving up)

JERRY
(Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these, anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting and loss of fur"? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog
pills!

KRAMER
Whe have the same symptoms.

JERRY
But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.

KRAMER
No, no. No doctors.

JERRY
Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat)

KRAMER
Where are you going?

JERRY
I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?

KRAMER
I don't know..

JERRY
(Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon!
(Kramer eagerly gets up and runs out the door. Jerry follows Kramer out)

[SETTING
Taxi cab]
(Elaine's riding in the back seat of a taxi)

DRIVER
Lady, could you move your head a little bit?

ELAINE
What?

DRIVER
Your head. I can't see out the back. (Elaine slumps down in her seat) Little more.. (Elaine slumps lower) ..Little more. (Slides down until just her eyes and
forehead can be seen) Thank you.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Jerry's car]
(Jerry is driving to an unknown destination. Kramer is restless in the back. He's scrambling around, looking out the windows - just as a dog would)

KRAMER
I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the
way to the park! (Starts getting even more energetic) Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! (Looks at Jerry, scared) You're taking me to the doctor!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Coffee shop]
(George is at the coffee shop with his parents)

GEORGE
So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..

ESTELLE
I feel a draft. (Grabs the bread basket and her drink) Let's change tables.

FRANK
Get outta here! We have a booth.

ESTELLE
Frank, I'm cold!

FRANK
Order a hot dish.

ESTELLE
Why can't we sit over there? (Points to a table)

FRANK
(Yelling) That's not a booth!

ESTELLE
(Trying to match Frank's loudness) So, who says we have to sit in a booth?!

FRANK
(Loud shouting) I didn't take the subway all the way to New York to sit at a table like that! (Gestures to the table)

ESTELLE
(Nagging yell) Well, I didn't take the subway to be in a drafty restaurant!
(A moment passes)

GEORGE
(Pleading for them to stop) Mom.. dad.

FRANK
Now, George, what do you want to know about your childhood?

GEORGE
(Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.

FRANK
(Looks up) Where's that breeze coming from?
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
NYC Street]
(Jerry's car is parked outside of the doctor's office. Kramer refuses to get out of the car)

JERRY
Kramer, outta the car. Out, now!

KRAMER
No, Jerry!

JERRY
Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car)

KRAMER
No! Don't!
(Jerry pulls Kramer out onto the sidewalk. Kramer quickly gets up and takes off - running down the street)

JERRY
Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Tenant board room]
(Mr. Eldridge is telling his story to the board members. Each one looked touched by the tale. George, on the other hand, is bored to death. He's leaning back in his
chair in the corner of the room, knocking on the wall - to display how bored he is)

ELDRIDGE
Just then, a rescue ship emerged from the fog and saved us. It was.. (Stops, then gives George a look. George stops knocking on the walls) It was the
sweetest sight my eyes ever saw.

RICARDI
(Touched) Thank you Mr. Eldridge. The tenant board will now hear Mr. Costanza's testimony.
(George gets up, walks over to Mr. Eldridge, then gestures for him to give up his chair. Eldridge reluctantly gets up and takes George's seat in the corner)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Newman's apartment]
(Jerry enters. Newman has an ice pac on his ankle)

JERRY
Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened?

NEWMAN
Kramer bit me!

JERRY
Bit you?!

NEWMAN
We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii, and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled! I don't think I can do my route -
and they're awarding the transfer in two days!

JERRY
(Bravely) Well, what if I deliver it?

NEWMAN
You?! (Laughs hysterically) You can't deliver mail!

JERRY
Well, why not?

NEWMAN
(Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right. It's just walking around putting it into boxes..

JERRY
What am I gonna wear?

NEWMAN
I could give you my uniform from my rookie year.

JERRY
(Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
(Scene cuts to Jerry on Newman's route. He's walking along a city street with a mail cart. He stops infront of a store owner brooming the sidewalk)

JERRY
(Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!

OWNER
Mail on Sunday?

JERRY
(Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Tenant board room]
(George is telling the board his astonishing life stories. Every board member seems to be deeply moved by them)

GEORGE
I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a
Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts
to, yet, another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing
statements) In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short,
stocky, slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi
is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying
erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Newman's apartment]
(Jerry returns to get another bag of mail)

JERRY
Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend".

NEWMAN
"Do not bend". (Laughs evilly) Just crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand..
very well. (Hangs up in disappointment)

JERRY
What?

NEWMAN
That was the Vice President of the post office. I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!

JERRY
How did they know?!

NEWMAN
(Stands up) Too many people go their mail! Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!

JERRY
(Pleading) I tried my best!

NEWMAN
Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform. (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame. Newman then tears the post office
badge from Jerry's coat)

JERRY
You know, this is your coat.

NEWMAN
(Realizing) Damn!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Central park]
(Elaine passes a man on a bench. All the sudden, a bird flies right into Elaine's head, and falls to the ground. The bird regains it's balance, and flies off. The man on
the bench is staring in awe)

MAN 2
He flew right into your head. Like he couldn't avoid it.

ELAINE
(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?

MAN 2
Never seen that before. Bird into a woman's head..
(Elaine covers her head with her hands, and runs off)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Coffee shop]

GEORGE
It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.

JERRY
Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?

GEORGE
They're making their decision today.
(Elaine enters. She has a scarf over her head - trying to tie her hair down. She looks angered at something)

JERRY
What's the matter with you?

ELAINE
Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)

JERRY
What giant freak-head?

ELAINE
(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!

JERRY
So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!

ELAINE
(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or
jam a fork into his forehead.

JERRY
(Casually, sarcastic) Either way.

ELAINE
(Getting up to leave) Alright.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Restaurant]

ALAN
I want to apologize for..

ELAINE
(Shrugging it off) Oh, please.

ALAN
So you have a big head.

ELAINE
(Casually playing along) So what?

ALAN
It goes well with that bump in your nose.

ELAINE
(Suddenly angry) What?!
(Scene cuts to the outside of the restaurant. A woman runs out of the restaurant and stops a passing Kramer)

WOMAN
Please! Get help! There's a crazy big-headed woman beating up some guy! Tell the police "The Old Mill Restaurant". Hurry!
(Kramer takes off running down the street, looking for a cop. He meets up with two officers exiting an ice cream shop. Before he can tell them the urgent message,
he starts coughing uncontrollably)

COP
Boy, that's some cough you got there.
(Kramer keeps coughing while making gestures)

COP 2
No, I think he's trying to tell us something. What is it? (Between coughs, Kramer manages to say the word "trouble") Trouble?! Trouble? Where? Where's
trouble? (Kramer coughs out the words "Old Mill") Trouble at the Old Mill?! Oh my god! Good boy, good boy! Lead the way! Come on.
(Kramer starts running back to the restaurant, the cops following him)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
George's apartment building]
(George enters the hallway only to find that a bandaged-up Alan is moving boxes into George's would-be-apartment)

GEORGE
Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?

ALAN
I'm moving in. Alan Mercer. New neighbor. (They shake hands)

GEORGE
What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!

ALAN
Yeah.

GEORGE
Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead)

ALAN
Oh, fork in the forehead.

GEORGE
That's why they gave you the apartment?

ALAN
No, I just gave the super 50 bucks.

GEORGE
Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!

ALAN
Tough luck, chinless. (Goes into his new apartment, and slams the door on George)
(George starts acting self-conscious about his chin - much like Elaine and her head)
End.
[Subway Train]
Jerry and Elaine sit side by side on a subway train. They're both reading
newspapers, when something occurs to Jerry.

JERRY
You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession
stand?

ELAINE
Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the
banjo?

JERRY
He's wailing on that banjo.

ELAINE
Yeah.

JERRY
I just don't understand the raisinettes.

ELAINE
The sax player?

JERRY
Yeah.

ELAINE
Yeah.

JERRY
The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another
box of raisinettes.

ELAINE
So?

JERRY
Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.

ELAINE
HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.

JERRY
Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.

ELAINE
He's a musician.

JERRY
Musicians. Get a real job.
They shrug and return to their reading.
[Monk's]
George is sitting at the counter perusing a magazine. The waitress comes over
to take his order.

WAITRESS
What d'you want?

GEORGE
Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.
The waitress disappears out back. George goes back to reading. Behind him, a
beautiful woman enters, and approaches him.

DANIELLE
(to George) Neil.
The woman touches George on his shoulder, to get his attention.

DANIELLE
Neil.
George turns to face the woman.

DANIELLE
(apologetic) Oh, I am sorry. (smiling broadly) I'm supposed to meet
my boyfriend here. He looks just like you.

GEORGE
(bemused) Really?

DANIELLE
(smiling) Yeah.

GEORGE
(pointing to himself) Like me?

DANIELLE
Uh-huh. Sorry.
Danielle walks away with a wave. George sits there, looking stunned.

GEORGE
(confused, to himself) Like me? But how?
The waitress returns from the back and puts a plate down on the counter
before George.

WAITRESS
Here's your halibut omelette. Surprised?

GEORGE
Yes, yes, I am.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry has a suitcase on the table, packing for a trip. Kramer has brought in
a large paper bag, from which he pulls a blue t-shirt.

KRAMER
Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was
closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.
Kramer holds the shirt up against Jerry and admires it. On the front of the
shirt is the legend '#1 DAD'.

KRAMER
Saved a fortune. Look at that. Heyy.

JERRY
(reading, unimpressed) Ohh, 'Number 1 Dad'.

KRAMER
Yeah.

JERRY
(examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.
George enters.

KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Hey.

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
Hey. You ready?

JERRY
Almost.

KRAMER
Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off
some Cubans for me at your parents' house?

JERRY
(reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo.
I'm gonna be busy.

KRAMER
Aw, c'mon man. Help a brother out.

JERRY
(grudging) Alright.

KRAMER
Yeahh. I owe you one.

JERRY
(holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.
Kramer leaves. George has got himself a bottle of water from the fridge and
wanders into the living room, talking.

GEORGE
Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful
girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.

JERRY
(continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.

GEORGE
(incredulous) I look just like him. I. Me. (flings his arms out)
This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?

JERRY
Maybe he has money.

GEORGE
(wondering) Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same,
except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.

JERRY
(zipping up his bag) Sometimes you do.

GEORGE
Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or
wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.

JERRY
(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?
Jerry opens the door as George looks at him.

GEORGE
(pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.
George leaves, followed by Jerry.
[Outside Movie Theatre]
Elaine and her latest boyfriend are standing in line.

BLAINE
So, what d'you wanna see?

ELAINE
(indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch?

BLAINE
(indicating another poster) How about The English Patient? It's up
for all those Oscars.
Elaine pulls a face, like she's really not interested in seeing Blaine's
choice.

ELAINE
Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.

BLAINE
It's a family in a brown paper bag.

ELAINE
(laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there?

BLAINE
No.
Elaine and Blaine reach the front of the queue, just as the guy in the ticket
booth puts a sign up on the window saying 'Sack Lunch Sold Out'.

ELAINE
(disappointment) Aww. Sold out.

BLAINE
(to the booth guy) Oh, two for The English Patient.
Elaine continues to study the Sack Lunch poster, while Blaine buys tickets.

ELAINE
So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?
[Monk's]
Danielle, the beautiful woman, is paying at the register. George enters and
sees her.

GEORGE
(smiling) Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like
Neil?

DANIELLE
(smiling back) Hi.

GEORGE
Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm, is Neil here?

DANIELLE
Oh, no. He got held up at work.

GEORGE
Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look
so similar.

DANIELLE
Well, you know, you don't look that much like him.

GEORGE
(disappointment) Oh. Course not.

DANIELLE
No, you're a little taller.
George looks ever more bewildered.

DANIELLE
You look like you're in better shape than Neil. Do you work out?

GEORGE
(smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...
Danielle looks like she thinks George is hitting on her, and she's not
against the idea.

GEORGE
...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone
number?
Now it's Danielle's time to look surprised and bewildered.
[Outside Movie Theatre]
Elaine and Blaine emerge from the exit, having seen The English Patient.

ELAINE
(very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about "The English
Patient, it's so romantic". (vehement) God, that movie stunk!

BLAINE
I kinda liked it.

ELAINE
(firm) No you didn't.
From the exit emerge several of Elaine's friends, who hurry over to see her.
They're all holding tissues.

CAROL
Elaine. Elaine, did you just see The English Patient?

GAIL
(tearful) Didn't you love it?

LISA
How could you not love that movie?

ELAINE
How about, it sucked?

CAROL
That Ralph Fiennes, I would give up my firstborn for him.

ELAINE
(aside) Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.
Blaine gives Elaine a strange look.
[Recreation Center, Del Boca Vista]
Jerry and Morty walk into a room which contains some fitness equipment -
exercise bike, weights, etc.

MORTY
Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's new physical fitness room. They got
medicine balls, you can bike ride, anything you want.

JERRY
Stairmaster?

MORTY
What?

JERRY
Nothin'.

MORTY
(opening his tracksuit top) See what I'm wearing?
Morty has on the '#1 DAD' shirt.

JERRY
Oh, did you get that outta my bag?

MORTY
No, your mother found it. Son, this is the most wonderful and
thoughtful thing you've ever done for me.

JERRY
You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.
In through the door comes a really old guy. He jogs slowly in, and begins
doing physical jerks as Morty talks to Jerry.

MORTY
Hoh, here he is. This is the man I wanted you to see. Izzy
Mandelbaum. He's eighty years old, but strong as an ox. (pointing) Watch
this.
Izzy picks up a set of weights and lifts them chest high.

MORTY
See that? You couldn't do that.

JERRY
I could, but I choose not to.
Another guy enters behind the Seinfelds. He walks over to an exercise bike
and climbs aboard.

SID
Hey Morty. (nodding toward Jerry) Who's this?

MORTY
This is my son Jerry, from New York. (leaning toward Sid) He thinks he
can lift more than Izzy.

JERRY
(protesting) I..I didn't say that.

SID
(calling over) Hey, Izzy, this kid says he can lift more than you can.
Izzy looks over. He releases his grip on the weights and they drop to the
floor with a clunk.

IZZY
Your kid's pretty funny, Morty. Should be a comedian.

JERRY
(smiles) Actually, I am a comedian.

SID
That's not so funny.

IZZY
(challenging) Think you're better than me, huh?

MORTY
Izzy used to work out with Charles Atlas in the fifties.

JERRY
(jocular) Eighteen-fifties?

IZZY
Yeah, that's it. It's go time. (points to the weights he put down)
Let's see you lift that.

JERRY
(reluctant) Mr Mandelbaum, I...

IZZY
C'mon, c'mon. Pump it!

JERRY
(consenting) Alright.

IZZY
Yeah, wrong attitude. you're not bringing that trash into my house.
Jerry walks over and picks the weights up easily.

JERRY
There. Alright?

IZZY
Step aside, stringbean.
Jerry puts down the weights, and rolls them out of the way. Izzy steps in
front of a much, much, more substantial set of weights.

IZZY
I'll show you. We're gonna take it up a notch.
Izzy bends and takes hold of the bar. The second he puts any effort into the
lift, there is a loud crunching noise and a pained look of horror comes to
his face.

IZZY
(agonised) Ah! My back. Ugh.
Izzy keeps hold of the bar as he slowly keels over forwards. The circular
weights roll in front of him and Izzy gently falls forward until he's face
down on the floor.

IZZY
(drawn out) Aaaahh.
Jerry, Morty and Sid, look on, concerned.

SID
Somebody, call an ambulance.

MORTY
(unpanicked) There's already an ambulance here for Mrs Glickman.
There's room for one more.
[Outside Movie Theatre]
Elaine is at the same movie theatre as before,but alone this time. She's
buying her ticket from the booth.

ELAINE
(handing over her money) Okay, one for Sack Lunch. (taking the
ticket) It's good, right? (smiling) Yeah, good.
Elaine turns to enter the theatre, and meets Gail, Carol and Lisa coming out.

ELAINE
(surprise) Hey, what're you guys doing here?

LISA
We just saw The English Patient again.

GAIL
It's even better the second time.

ELAINE
They make it longer?
Out of the theatre comes Blaine, carrying an umbrella.

BLAINE
(to the girls) Got my umbrella.

ELAINE
(shocked) Blaine!?

BLAINE
Elaine.

ELAINE
I thought you were busy tonight.

BLAINE
(cold) Well, to tell you the truth Elaine. I don't know if I can be
with someone who doesn't like The English Patient.

ELAINE
It's just a stupid movie.

BLAINE
(to Carol) That's what I'm talking about.

CAROL
(taking Blaine's arm) Come on, Blaine. Let's go.

BLAINE
(bitter) Enjoy Sack Lunch!
Blaine walks away with the girls.

ELAINE
(fierce) I will!
[Seinfeld Residence, Del Boca Vista]
Helen is talking to Jerry, with Morty on the couch. Helen and Morty are in
their nightclothes. Morty has on the '#1 DAD' shirt.

HELEN
(accusing) How could you do that to Mr Mandelbaum? You should be
ashamed of yourself.

JERRY
(defensive) He egged me on.

HELEN
You should be more mature.

JERRY
He's eighty!

MORTY
(standing) Okay. Tomorrow, Jerry and I will visit Izzy and apologise.
Now, goodnight.
Morty begins to head to the bedroom.

HELEN
(walking after Morty) You're not sleeping in that shirt. It's too
tight.

MORTY
This shirt will never leave my body.
Helen follows Morty down the short hallway.

HELEN
(to Jerry) Goodnight.

JERRY
(smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.
There is a knock at the door. Jerry answers it. Outside are three
Hispanic-looking guys.

GUILLERMO
Jerry Seinfeld please.

JERRY
Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the
cigars?
The guys enter.

GUILLERMO
What cigars?

JERRY
Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.

GUILLERMO
(indicating the threesome) We are the Cubans.
Jerry stares, stunned.
[Jerry's Apartment/Del Boca Vista]
Kramer stands, shirtless, in Jerry's kitchen. There's a pot on the stove, and
Kramer's chopping vegetables on a board. The phone rings and Kramer answers.

KRAMER
Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.
In the Seinfelds' condo, the three guys are asleep on the fold-out couch and
a chair, while an upset Jerry rants into the phone.

JERRY
(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!

KRAMER
I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?

JERRY
Cigars!

KRAMER
Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got
these guys.

JERRY
(incredulous) You're making your own cigars now?

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.
Behind Jerry, Morty wanders over to the kitchen counter.

JERRY
(to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad.
Morty sorts through some pill bottles, before picking one out.

MORTY
(without looking up) Who are they?

JERRY
They're Cuban cigar rollers.

MORTY
(walking back out of the room) Don't tell your mother.
Something catches Jerry's ear on the phone.

JERRY
What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?

KRAMER
Hot and spicy.

JERRY
(accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you?

KRAMER
Yes I am.

JERRY
What colour is it?
Kramer looks down at his bare torso, and can't think.

KRAMER
Damn!
Kramer hangs up the phone.
[New York Hallway]
George and Danielle walk up to her door in her building. George has a napkin
in his hand on which is some scribbled numbers. Danielle is looking at
George, very much as if she's interested.

GEORGE
You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't
have to take me out to dinner.

DANIELLE
I wanted to give it to you in person.
George shrugs his understanding.

DANIELLE
(flirtatious) You know, I don't have to be up in the morning, and I
know a great breakfast place, right around the corner.
Danielle gives George a big smile. George smiles, but thoughtfully.

GEORGE
Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?

DANIELLE
(inviting) Why don't you come in? We'll take about it.

GEORGE
(looking at his watch) I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna
be home in case Neil calls.

DANIELLE
Well, goodnight.
Danielle leans toward George, for a kiss. But George walks away completely
oblivious to Danielle.

GEORGE
(hurried) I'll see you.
Danielle looks down the hall after George, looking perplexed.
[Monk's]
An unhappy Elaine sits at the counter as the waitress pours her coffee.

WAITRESS
Rough night?

ELAINE
Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who
I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't
like that stupid English Patient movie.

WAITRESS
Really? I thought it was pretty good.

ELAINE
Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes!
I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!

WAITRESS
(sour) Well, I liked it.
The waitress takes the coffee pot and walks away into the back.

ELAINE
(calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello?
(irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!
[Mandelbaum Residence, Del Boca Vista]
Jerry and Morty stroll into the bedroom of the hugely impressive Mandelbaum
condo. Morty is still wearing the '#1 DAD' shirt under his tracksuit. Izzy is

JERRY
This is quite a condo.

MORTY
The Mandelbaums own the Magic Pan restaurants.

JERRY
The crepe place?

MORTY
Yeah. This is all big crepe money.

JERRY
(doubtful) There's crepe money?
Izzy wakes up and sees the Seinfelds at the foot of his bed.

IZZY
What are you doing here?

JERRY
(apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you
how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
Izzy stares at Morty as Jerry speaks.

IZZY
What the hell is that?

JERRY
What?

IZZY
That shirt. You think that you are the number one dad?

MORTY
This was a gift from my son.
Morty displays the shirt proudly. Jerry smiles.

IZZY
Oh, I see how it works now. (indicates Jerry) He knocks me outta
commission, so (indicates Morty) you can strut around in your fancy number
one shirt. (moves the bedcovers) Well, I'll show you who's number one.
Izzy starts to move to get out of bed.

JERRY
Mr Mandelbaum, please.

IZZY
It's go time.
Izzy stands up and there is a familiar crunching noise. Izzy freezes in his
stance, arms raised.

IZZY
(pained) Ahh. My back. I can't move.
Jerry and Morty look on with horrified concern.

MORTY
Call an ambulance.

JERRY
I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
Jerry darts out of the door, followed moments later by Morty.
[Jerry's Apartment/Del Boca Vista]
Jerry has just returned from Florida, and is putting away his bag. A worried
George sits at the table.

JERRY
(disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you
thought some guy might be calling you?!
Jerry puts his bag in the bedroom and returns as George paces the floor.

GEORGE
(animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he
could get a girl like Danielle.

JERRY
(pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about
Neil. You've out-Neiled him.

GEORGE
(surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?

JERRY
I don't know, but you better keep it up.

GEORGE
I'm gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) There's a new Neil in
town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha!
George exits, cheerfully. The phone rings as the door closes.

JERRY
(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole
operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.
In Florida, Helen and Morty each have a handset. Morty is still wearing the
'#1 DAD' shirt.

MORTY
Hey Jerry. Number One here. Did you go see Izzy at the back
specialist?

JERRY
I will, I just walked in the door.

HELEN
You have to go see him.

JERRY
Ma.

MORTY
Helen, will you stop bothering him.

HELEN
Jerry, that shirt is gone right to his head.

MORTY
Number One, signing off.
The Seinfelds hang up. Jerry's door opens and Kramer bursts in, agitated.

KRAMER
Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill)
What's going on!?

JERRY
What?

KRAMER
(animated) They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans.

JERRY
So?

KRAMER
So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.

JERRY
What's the difference?

KRAMER
Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like
it.

JERRY
(confused) We're talking about people, right?

KRAMER
Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These
guys don't have it.

JERRY
I thought they smelled pretty nice.

KRAMER
Jerry, your palate's unrefined.

JERRY
Is not.

KRAMER
Is too.

JERRY
Is not.

KRAMER
Is too.

JERRY
I'm not having this conversation.

KRAMER
Are too.

JERRY
Am not.

KRAMER
Are too.

JERRY
Am not.

KRAMER
Are too.
[J Peterman's Office]
Peterman lounges behind his desk, as Elaine and another employee pick up
notes, photographs, etc.

PETERMAN
Another productive meeting. By the way, I saw that English Patient
film last night. It was extraordinary.

DUGAN
(enthusiastic) Oh yes. It was so romantic. It ravished me.
Dugan walks away.

PETERMAN
Elaine, what'd you think?

ELAINE
(hesitant) Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't
tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.

PETERMAN
(aghast) You haven't seen it?

ELAINE
(shakes head) No.

PETERMAN
That's it! Drop everything. We're going right now.
Peterman stuffs some paperwork into a desk drawer.
[The New York Hospital]
Izzy is in a hospital bed, as Jerry stands beside it.

JERRY
Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best.
So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and
find my number.
Jerry turns to walk out.

IZZY
Uh, oh, wait.
Izzy rummages on his bedside table and picks up a t-shirt. He holds it up to
his chest so Jerry can read what's written on it. 'World's Greatest DAD!'

IZZY
How 'bout that, huh? The World's Greatest Dad. My son made it for me.

JERRY
(humouring him) That's very nice.

IZZY
The best in the world. (pointing to himself) Which means I'm better
than just number one.

JERRY
Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
Behind Jerry, an elderly bald guy leans round the doorframe and raps on the
door, attracting Izzy's attention.

IZZY
Hi, son.

IZZY JR.
Hi daddy.

JERRY
(surprise) This is your son?

IZZY
I got married in high school.

IZZY JR.
(to Jerry) Hey, who are you?

IZZY
This is Seinfeld's kid.

IZZY JR.
Oh, you think you're tough, picking on an old man? (squaring up to
Jerry) Maybe you'd like to try taking on somebody your own age.

JERRY
(jocular) You got any kids?

IZZY JR.
Oh, you think you're better than me? (challenging) Go ahead, pick
out anything in the room here. I'll lift it up over my head.

JERRY
(trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything.

IZZY
(pointing) The television.

JERRY
(under his breath) Oh no.
Izzy Jr walks over to the TV, which sits on top of a cabinet.

IZZY JR.
This one's for you, Pop. It's go time.
Izzy Jr takes a grip on the TV, but there's another crunching sound as he
tries to lift, and an agonised expression comes to his face. Jerry cringes in
the background.

IZZY JR.
(pained) Ohh! My back!

IZZY
(urgent) Call an ambulance.

JERRY
(laconic) We're already in a hospital.
[Earl Haffler's Office]
A suit-wearing Kramer is in the office of Earl Haffler - cigar-smoking,
stetson-wearing, Texan businessman.

HAFFLER
Awright, partner. Let's get down to business.

KRAMER
(nervous) Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.
Kramer walks over to the door trying to smile confidently.

KRAMER
They're right out here.
Kramer calls a few words of nonsense Spanish out of the door, and the three
guys stroll in. They are dressed in Castro-style green fatigues and caps.

KRAMER
Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.
Earl Haffler regards the three for a second or two.

HAFFLER
You wouldn't be trying to sell old Earl Haffler Dominicans in a
Cuban wrapper now, would you?

KRAMER
(fidgety) Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more
Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.

HAFFLER
(confusion) We're talking about people, right?

KRAMER
(puzzled) I think so.

HAFFLER
I thought he quit smoking cigars.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for
a second) ...Dennis.

HAFFLER
(dubious) Dennis Castro?

KRAMER
Uh, Dwayne.

HAFFLER
Get the hell outta my office.

KRAMER
(shrill) What!?
[Monk's]
Danielle and George walk over to, and sit in, a booth.

DANIELLE
You know, Neil called me today.

GEORGE
(interested) Really?

DANIELLE
Yeah. He's pretty upset that I broke up with him to go out with
you.

GEORGE
(smug) Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.

DANIELLE
He wants to get together tomorrow night and have coffee.

GEORGE
(little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me.

DANIELLE
(surprised) What?

GEORGE
(smiles) Beats the hell out of coffee.
Danielle smiles at George, still a touch confused.
[Movie Theatre]
Peterman and Elaine sit in the auditorium. The English Patient is playing and
many of the crowd are tearfully dabbing their eyes. Peterman is particularly
emotional. Elaine looks completely bored, and is tossing pieces of popcorn up
in the air to try and catch them in her mouth.

PETERMAN
(emotional) And I thought I knew what love was.
One of Elaine's bits of popcorn misses her mouth and falls behind her seat.
Elaine twists round and reaches over to retrieve it, before slumping in her
seat wearily.

ELAINE
(indifferent) Yuh.
[Monk's]
Jerry and George sit in a booth. George looks ragged and is swigging from a
bottle of some anti-acid medication.

JERRY
(incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?

GEORGE
I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.

JERRY
(musing) What if it's Neil Armstrong?
George thinks for a moment, his eyes twitching.

GEORGE
(animated) Then I'm going to Mars!

JERRY
What if it's Neil Diamond?

GEORGE
(tormented) Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!

JERRY
Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.

GEORGE
What, to see the old guy?

JERRY
No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.

GEORGE
How old's the son?

JERRY
I think he's the same age as the father.

GEORGE
What is with this family?

JERRY
I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench
press the casket.
Kramer sidles into the coffee shop. He peers past the register, to where the
three guys are sitting in the far corner, talking together. Then he moves
over to join Jerry and George.

KRAMER
(quietly) Hey, Jerry.
Kramer indicates the three guys with his thumb.

KRAMER
(noise - like shivery) Datiditadit.

JERRY
You're cold?

KRAMER
No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat.

JERRY
Something wrong with your chest?

KRAMER
(indicating with his thumb) Dijadidatjd. There.

JERRY
(leaning round Kramer) Where?

KRAMER
(urgent) No, no. Don't look. Don't look.
Jerry and George look as if they're infected by Kramer's nervousness, as they
try and look surreptitiously at the Dominicans.

KRAMER
Over there. The Dominicans.

JERRY
Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?

KRAMER
Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to
do.

GEORGE
So?

KRAMER
So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You
know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.
In the corner, one of the Dominicans thumps the table, as if to underscore a
point in his argument.

JERRY
Boy, they seem pretty angry about something.

KRAMER
(nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the
people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself,
shrill) El Presidente!
Again, one of the Dominicans thumps the table. Kramer jumps at the sound.
[The New York Hospital]
Izzy and Izzy Jr are laid up in beds placed side-by-side.

JERRY
I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.

IZZY JR.
I bet you pulled that trick on my daddy, in Florida.

JERRY
He couldn't handle the weight.

IZZY
(hostile) Oh, so now you think you're better than me?

IZZY JR.
(indicating Izzy) You think you're better than him?!

JERRY
(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're
both better than me.

IZZY
Okay.
An even more elderly guy than Izzy enters the room behind Jerry. He spreads
his arms in greeting to the Mandelbaums.

IZZY SR.
My boys.

IZZY
My dad.

IZZY JR.
My grandpa.

JERRY
(incredulous) Oh, come on!

IZZY SR.
(indicating Izzy Jr) What happened to him?

JERRY
He was trying to lift the TV.

IZZY SR.
(pointing) That TV?
Izzy Sr. strides purposefully toward the TV.

JERRY
(consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.
Off-screen there is a familiar crunching sound

IZZY IZZY SR.. (O.C.)
(pained) Oohh!
[The New York Hospital]
All three of the Mandelbaums are in a row of beds in the same room.

IZZY SR.
Why didn't anybody tell me? It was bolted down!

IZZY
I still thought you could do it.

IZZY JR.
Me too.

IZZY/IZZY JR/IZZY IZZY SR.
(chanting and punching the air) Mandelbaum,
Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...

JERRY
Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.

IZZY
Oh yeah, that's right. Go. Put us all in the hospital. And you've
ruined our business with all your macho head games.

JERRY
(defensive) I didn't ruin your business.

IZZY
Yes, you did. There's nobody there now at the Magic Pan to roll the
crepes. We gotta close it up.

JERRY
(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?

IZZY
Each crepe has to be hand-rolled by a Mandelbaum. That's what puts the
magic in Magic Pan!

JERRY
(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?

IZZY
Yeah.

JERRY
(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
Jerry turns and starts to leave, but is called back.

IZZY SR.
(calls) Hey, I can't see the TV.
Jerry walks to the TV and picks it,and the attached cabinet up. HE carries it
across the room to the foot of Izzy Sr.'s bed,where he places it.

JERRY
Here.
Jerry walks out of the room followed by the angry cries of Izzy.

IZZY
You think you're better than us,don't you?! Huh!?
[Movie Theatre]
Peterman and Elaine are still in front of The English Patient. Peterman
stares, enraptured, at the screen. Elaine is totally frantic with boredom.

PETERMAN
Elaine, I hope you're watching the clothes, because I can't take my
eyes off the passion.

ELAINE
(quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too
long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid
desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!
The other movie patrons turn and shush Elaine, who sits back in her seat.

PETERMAN
(surprised) Elaine. You don't like the movie?

ELAINE
(shouts) I hate it!!

CROWD
Shh!

ELAINE
(shouts) Oh, go to hell!!

PETERMAN
(quietly) Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You're
fired.

ELAINE
(grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside.
Elaine hurriedly gets out of her seat and leaves.
[Magic Pan Restaurant]
Jerry and Elaine sit in a booth, talking over coffee.

JERRY
He was gonna fire you?

ELAINE
The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and
visit the Tunisian desert.

JERRY
Tunisia?

ELAINE
That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.

JERRY
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.

ELAINE
I have to live in a cave.

JERRY
(sardonic) Oh. (smiles)
Kramer comes over to the booth.

KRAMER
These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that.
It's like they're rolling a double corona.
The three Dominican guys are making crepes, and then rolling them around
fillings.

KRAMER
(to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?
The Dominican smiles back.
Over in another part of the restaurant, Danielle sits in a booth with Neil.
Neil is clearly bald, but has his back to the camera.

DANIELLE
I'm very happy with George. I'm sorry Neil, it's over.
Neil's head drops at this news.

DANIELLE
Come on, let's just eat our crepes.
The Dominicans are handing out plates of rolled crepes to various tables.
At one table a customer prods a rolled crepe with his fork and a jet of
scalding hot filling squirts out into his face.

CUSTOMER
(pained scream) Aaghh!! My face!
At another table, another customer digs his fork in, and is rewarded with a
faceful of blistering filling.
Neil sticks his fork into his crepe and recoils as hot liquid jets into his
face.

DANIELLE
(concerned cry) Neil!
The restaurant is in chaos as yells of pain come from all sides. Elaine,
Jerry and Kramer look round at the commotion.

JERRY
Why are the crepes spraying?

KRAMER
(looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too
tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.
Another scream rents the air.
[Metropolitan Hospital Center]
In a hospital room, Neil lies in a bed, his face obscured with bandages and
an IV line connected to him. Danielle is there fussing with the remains of a
hospital meal on a tray. George enters.

GEORGE
Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him?

DANIELLE
Yeah, that blueberry crepe burned him pretty badly.
George picks up a walking stick which was propped against the bed.

GEORGE
(to Danielle) Whose cane is this?

DANIELLE
It's Neil's.
Danielle walks away with a water jug from Neil's table. She goes to a sink in
the corner as George speaks.

GEORGE
(to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to Neil) So, we meet at last. I
admire your skills, Mr Peanut.
Danielle brings back the jug.

GEORGE
Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) we should get going. I got a key
made for you.
George flourishes a doorkey before Danielle.

DANIELLE
George, I can't move in with you.

GEORGE
(shocked) What?

DANIELLE
I'm sorry, but I'm taking Neil to a clinic in England.

GEORGE
(animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll
burn myself. I'll burn my parents!

DANIELLE
Sorry George.
Danielle takes the jug and leaves the room. Dejectedly, George wanders toward
the door. As he moves, Neil whispers to him.

NEIL
(beckoning) George.
George leans over to Neil, so he can hear him speak.

NEIL
(quiet triumph) I win.
George purses his lips and nods ruefully. He stands up and leaves, closing
the door behind him. There is a brief pause, then the door opens a few inches
and George's hand reaches back inside the room, takes hold of the IV line and
tugs it sharply, breaking it free of the IV bag,and drops it. Then the hand
is withdrawn and the door closes again.
[Plane]
Elaine sits in an aisle seat in a 747, reading a Let's Go Tunisia book. She
listens as a voice comes over the tannoy.

TAN
Ladies and gentlemen. In just one moment, we'll be showing our feature
presentation...

ELAINE
(dread) No, no, no, no, no.

TAN
...the comedy hit, Sack Lunch, starring Dabney Coleman.

ELAINE
(cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.
Smiling, Elaine puts down her book to watch the movie. Someone from a seat
beside her wants to get out.

GUY
Excuse me, please.

ELAINE
Oh, sure.
The guy pushes past her. He's holding a rolled-up magazine closely to his
body, as if concealing something and, strangely, is wearing a '#1 DAD'
t-shirt. There's a little awkwardness as he squeezes by.

ELAINE
(uncomfortable) Ooh.
The guy walks down the aisle and turns to face the passengers. Two other guys
in '#1 DAD' t-shirts flank him. They are the three Dominican guys.

GUILLERMO
Ladies and gentlemen. Because we have been exploited by your Magic
Pan crepe restaurants...
From inside his magazine, Guillermo produces a revolver. The other two guys
also pull out guns, which they point upwards and cock, loudly.

GUILLERMO
...we are hijacking this plane to Cuba!
There is consternation among the passengers, shocked looks, gasps, etc.

GUILLERMO
Everyone stay in your seats. And shut that movie off!

ELAINE
(annoyed) Aww, nuts!
End.
[Monks]

GEORGE
Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.

JERRY
That's good stuff.

GEORGE
I can't to myself. I'm exhausted.

JERRY
Can you grab a nap at work.

GEORGE
Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'.

ELAINE
Bye.

JERRY
So what are you doing now?

ELAINE
I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.

JERRY
With a gentleman caller?

ELAINE
Yes, his name is Hal.

JERRY
The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.

ELAINE
It's the next best thing to being alone.
[Kramer enters - wet head]

JERRY
Shower?

KRAMER
No, pool. I just swam 200 laps.

ELAINE
You are kidding.

KRAMER
Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place.

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?

JERRY
A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.

ELAINE
Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?

ELAINE
What exactly was that kid?

KRAMER
Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid.
[Yankee Stadium]

WILHELM
Oh, George, have you seen the American league directory? It is a big green book. Oh, thanks kiddo.
[Central park]

HAL

ELAINE
Well I don't care. It was delicious.

ELAINE
Wanna sit down?

HAL
Oh, I don't sit on park benches. They're very bad for the back.

ELAINE
Really?

HAL
I threw my back out about 15 years ago. Ever since I have been very careful. I only buy furniture in the ergonomics store.

ELAINE
Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, "Back in ", or "Good Vertibrations".

HAL
Not this one. It's called the "Lumbar Yard".
[Jerry's Apartment]

CONRAD
Oh, Jerry are you okay with this hinge?

JERRY
Yeah.

CONRAD
I can get you any kind you want, you know. Four holes, three holes, two holes, bronze, no hinge at all.

JERRY
You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?

CONRAD
Oh, these are different.

JERRY
Drop one. . . . left!
[George enters]

GEORGE
Jerry, look at my eyes.

JERRY
A little less beady today.

GEORGE
Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.

JERRY
Sounds like a really cool fort.

CONRAD
Jerry, do you want a flat edge on this molding or do you want me to bevel it?

JERRY
I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.

GEORGE
Conrad, is it?

CONRAD
Conrad, Connie, or Con, whatever you prefer.

GEORGE
Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?

JERRY
He's kind of tied up here.

GEORGE
It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?

CONRAD
There is no normal, whatever jerry wants. He wants me here late, I'm here late, he wants me here early, I'm here early, he . . .

JERRY
Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?

CONRAD
Whatever you want.
[Next day - on the telephone]

JERRY
So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.

ELAINE
Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?

JERRY
I don't know.

ELAINE
Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!

DELIVERY GUY
Delivery. Elaine Benes?

ELAINE
Yeah.

DELIVERY GUY
We're from the Lumbar Yard, we got your mattress.

ELAINE
Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?
[Yankee Stadium]

GEORGE
Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, uh, for an alarm clock?

CONRAD
You mean like that big?

GEORGE
Like this.

CONRAD
Yeah, I can do that.

GEORGE
Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?

CONRAD
Blanket or quilt?

GEORGE
Blanket.

CONRAD
That thick?

GEORGE
Maybe like this.

CONRAD
Like that?

GEORGE
Yeah, like that.

CONRAD
If that is what you want.

GEORGE
That is what I want.
[Later]

CONRAD
Hey George, you want this cup holder mounted on the left, or the right, or the middle, . . .

GEORGE
Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better than my bed at home.

GEORGE
Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.

CONRAD
If that's what you want.

GEORGE
That's what I want.

W
Morning George.

GEORGE
Good morning Mr. Wilhelm.
[George escapes under his desk]

KRAMER
got problems Jerry.

JERRY
What happened?

KRAMER
Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine.

JERRY
How long did that last?

KRAMER
A half hour then diving class started. Well… that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't hold me, Jerry.
[Elaine enters]

JERRY
How was the movie?

ELAINE
I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.

JERRY
Why?

ELAINE
He's got a back problem.

JERRY
So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.

ELAINE
After one date!

KRAMER
What's that guy's last name again?

ELAINE
Kitzmiller.

KRAMER
Oh, that's right.

JERRY
So what are you going to do with the mattress?

ELAINE
I don't know. Chuck it?

KRAMER
Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom.

ELAINE
Oh, all right.

KRAMER
My old one sprung a leak.

ELAINE
You have a water bed?

KRAMER
Sand! It's like sleeping on the beach.

[CONRAD
enters]

CONRAD
Hi, Jerry I'm sorry I'm late. George and I have been up working all night long. I can make up the time in any number of ways.

JERRY
How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!

CONRAD
Couple of questions for you.

JERRY
No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.

CONRAD
All right Jerry. But I can figure it out myself any way you want.

JERRY
Just . . . do it.
[Jerry exits]
[George's office]

STEINBRENNER
Costanza? Where's Costanza? . . . Excus mois? Have you seen Costanza?

SECRETARY
I've seen him around.

STEINBRENNER
Um, I'm stuck on this song yesterday. I can't seem to get it out of my head. I don't know the name of that. "She's a heart breaker, love taker . . ..Oh. Oh" . . .very catchy. You know what? I can't stay awake for that guy. What is this? People? Um, the most beautiful people people. Ally Selica, Nothing wrong with that uh?
[Monks]

HAL
Elaine, your taking this totally the wrong way. That's not what Ii intended.

ELAINE
Well, what did you intend, Hal?

HAL
I just wanted you to have the comfort and report you deserve. That's why I had the mattress custom designed for you.

ELAINE
Custom designed?

HAL
They adjust the foam density and spring tension to your body type. I estimated your height and weight. Five eight, about 110 pounds?

ELAINE
Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.

HAL
So you do like the mattress?

ELAINE
Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.
[East River]

FATHER
Over there, that's Brooklyn . That's where Spike Lee lives.

SON
Hey, there's a man swimming in the water.

FATHER
Naw, that's probably just a dead body son. You see when the mob kills someone they through the body in the river.
[Jerry's hall]

KRAMER
Jer.

JERRY
Hi.

KRAMER
Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes.

JERRY
What is that smell?

KRAMER
That's East River.

JERRY
You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?

KRAMER
Technically Norfolk has more gross tonnage.

JERRY
How could you swim in that water?

KRAMER
I saw a couple of other guys out there.

JERRY
Swimming?

KRAMER
Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there.
[Jerry's apartment]
Jerry looks around the new renovation.
[Elaine's]

ELAINE
(on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye.

ELAINE
Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!
[George's Office]

STEINBRENNER
What is it with this guy? I've been waiting three and a half hours. Should I go? No way Jack! (But I'm not going to hum it to the guy at the record store again), I'll tell you that.

SECONRAD
Mr. Steinbrenner?

STEINBRENNER
That's what they call me.

SECONRAD
Your grandchildren are here to see you.

STEINBRENNER
Oh, well, send them in. Send the little tykes in. … little people .. pony express … wow,
[Jerry's]

JERRY
(on phone) hello.

GEORGE

JERRY
Who is this?

GEORGE
Jerry, . . .

XX
Hi,

GEORGE
Sh, sh, goodbye, sh, get away.

XX
Hi, I'm Brady.

GEORGE
?? get away??

JERRY
Why don't you just have him paged?

GEORGE
Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.

JERRY
A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?

GEORGE
Just CALL!

JERRY
I should have some reason.

STEINBRENNER
Hey you kids know tunes; see if this song rinSTEINBRENNER a bell, "Heartbreaker , . . . "

SECONRAD
Mr. Steinbrenner we just received a call. There's a bomb in the building.

STEINBRENNER
A bomb in the building, oh, m'god. Quick, everyone under the desk.
[Steinbrenner's office]

STEINBRENNER
Boy can you think of what went through my mind when I saw there wasn't going to be enough room under that desk for me and my babies.

GEORGE
I'm sorry sir.

STEINBRENNER
You know what I think? I think you knew about that bomb ahead of time.

GEORGE
What?

STEINBRENNER
???? about that bomb. You climbed under that desk because you have ESP. George, what's on my mind? . . . Meatballs! Huh? Unbelievable. Anyway this terrorist had a specific demand. Not more cheap adjustable hats on hat day. He wants fitted hats just like the players wear.
[Jerry's new renovated apartment]

ELAINE
Jerry, Jerry.

JERRY
Yeah.

ELAINE
What the hell is this? Where are you?

JERRY
Over here. You can see right through here.

ELAINE
What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.

JERRY
It's kind of cozy.

ELAINE
Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.

JERRY
Does it smell like the East River?

ELAINE
How did you know?

JERRY
Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.

ELAINE
Oh, GREAT!
[Kramer enters]

KRAMER
Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.

ELAINE
Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.

KRAMER
Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted.
[George enters]

GEORGE
Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?

ELAINE
Hi.

GEORGE
Hi. Look at how obtrusive this is.

ELAINE
It is obtrusive, isn't it?

KRAMER
It is very obtrusive.

JERRY
I don't think it's that bad.

KRAMER
You can't get a stool in here.

JERRY
No the stools go over there.

KRAMER
No, that's no good. I'm leaving.

ELAINE
I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.

GEORGE
Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?

JERRY
You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.

GEORGE
Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.

JERRY
Hey look at you.

GEORGE
Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT.

JERRY
No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.

GEORGE
??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING.

JERRY
Could you at least get a hat for me?

GEORGE
FINE? WHAT SIZE?

JERRY
Seven and five eighths

GEORGE
SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS!!

JERRY
Why are you shouting?

GEORGE
I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
[Elaine's]

HAL
So are you liking the mattress?

ELAINE
I am totally loving it. Uh, you know … we should um … get going.

HAL
What is that smell?

ELAINE
What smell?

HAL
I think it's the mattress. Did something happen to it.

ELAINE
No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots.

HAL
Claming?

ELAINE
Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop.
[Steinbrenner's office]

STEINBRENNER
Yes, yes, come in.

GEORGE
Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here.

STEINBRENNER
Just let me ask you something. Is it "February" or " February"? Because I prefer "Febuary" and what is this "ru"?
[phone rinSTEINBRENNER]

GEORGE
Let me put that on speaker phone.

STEINBRENNER
Hello are you the bomber?

JERRY
Yes this is the terrorist bomber.

STEINBRENNER
Costanza here is busting his ass on those hats.

JERRY
think I've changed my mind.

STEINBRENNER
You don't want them, then goodbye.

GEORGE
Good thinking, sir.

STEINBRENNER
Well what do you want instead?

JERRY
What?

STEINBRENNER
Well, you're the terrorist. You're going to want something.

JERRY
I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.

STEINBRENNER
All right George, you can handle that.
[George hangs up phone]

STEINBRENNER
Costanza what the hell are you doing?

GEORGE
You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.

STEINBRENNER
When someone's unstable, you don't stir the fat, George! You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to run around the stadium and close all the windows. That's where I'm going, pal. And I'll tell you something else. I'm very nervous.
[On the street]

ELAINE
Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.

HAL
It's just more cheese.

ELAINE
I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!

KRAMER
Oh, hey,

ELAINE
Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal.

KRAMER
Hal, .. uh Langerhans.

HAL
Kitzmiller.

KRAMER
Oh, Kitzmiller. That's right

ELAINE
You feeling jiff?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm jiff.

HAL
That smell…

KRAMER
Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.

ELAINE
Oh, baby.
[Under George's desk]
[alarm clock]

GEORGE
Lunch.
[At the river]

HAL
Kramer? Can I talk to you a minute?

KRAMER
Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . .

HAL
Kitzmiller.

KRAMER
That's it.

HAL
You and Elaine are pretty close.

KRAMER
Oh, we go back a ways.

HAL
And you've, . . . how do I put this? You've been in her bed?

KRAMER
That's right.

HAL
But this isn't still going on.

KRAMER
No, no. She put a stop to that.

HAL
That's all I needed to know. So you actually swim in this thing?

KRAMER
Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the back.

HAL
Great for the back. Right.

KRAMER
Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup.

CONRAD
You want it back the way it was?

JERRY
Yeah, that's right.

CONRAD
You know I don't get you Seinfeld. You want something one day. The next day you don't like it. Come on man, make a decision.
[phone rinSTEINBRENNER]

JERRY
One second. Hello.

ELAINE
Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.

JERRY
Just lie down.

ELAINE
I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.

JERRY
All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go.

CONRAD
Stay, go whatever.
[At the river, Hall and more people]

HAL
Hey, Kramer.

KRAMER
What's going on?

HAL
I told my Chiropractor how swimming in the river made my back heal. He recommended it to all his patients.

OLD MAN
Step aside.

KRAMER
He just sunk like a stone.
[Steinbrenner's office]

GEORGE
Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter.

STEINBRENNER
Don't be so sure George. Mess with them and they're messing with you. All right boys send it in
[bomb disposal robot enters George's office]

STEINBRENNER
What's that figure ahead? Is that anything? Okay, let's check the desk. That's where I heard the ticking. Search each one of those drawers starting with the top one. So, empty calories and male curiosity, eh, Georgie?

BOMB COP
Looks like there's more compartments underneath.

STEINBRENNER
Compartments underneath, that's probably where it is. Okay boys, let 'er rip. I'll tell you what George. Starting tomorrow no more desks. Just Lucite tables and four leSTEINBRENNER.

KRAMER
Yeah.

ELAINE
Yeah.
[Jerry's]

GEORGE
Hi Connie, Jerry around?

CONRAD
No, and I prefer "Conrad". So I heard what happened to the desk.

GEORGE
There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.

CONRAD
Yeah, well, whatever. See ya'
[Later at Jerry's]
[Jerry enters]

JERRY
Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
End.
Jerry with George and his girlfriend Marcy at Monk's.

GEORGE
So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday.

MARCY
Why?

GEORGE
I was naked.

MARCY
Oh, George.

JERRY
I saw it.

MARCY
How'd he look?

JERRY
Okay. I wouldn't see it again.

MARCY
You know, a friend of mine thought she got Legonare's disease in the hot tub.

GEORGE
Really? What happened?

MARCY
Oh, yada yada yada, just some bad egg salad. I'll be right back. (She gets up)

JERRY
I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada yada."

GEORGE
Is "yada yada" bad?

JERRY
No, "yada yada" is good. She's very succinct.

GEORGE
She is succinct.

JERRY
Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)

GEORGE
Hey.

JERRY
Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley.

GEORGE
Yeah, dentist of the stars.

JERRY
What's up?

TIM
I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.

JERRY
Excuse me?

TIM
I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago.

JERRY
Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.

TIM
Thanks.

GEORGE
Hey, where you just at the health club?

TIM
Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. (Jerry and George give confused looks)
% Elaine and Jerry at his place.

JERRY
Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.

ELAINE
So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night.

JERRY
Booze is not a religion.

ELAINE
Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me.

JERRY
Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.

ELAINE
What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried.

JERRY
I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.

ELAINE
Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)

KRAMER
Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?

MICKEY
We're double dating tonight, and if we wear the same shirt we'll look like idiots.

ELAINE
Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.

KRAMER
Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.

ELAINE
How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)
% Marcy and George in his car.

MARCY
So I'm on 3rd Avenue, mindin' my own business, and, yada yada yada, I get a free massage and a facial.

GEORGE
What a succinct story.

MARCY
I'm surprised you drive a Cadillac.

GEORGE
Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's.

MARCY
Are you close with your parents?

GEORGE
Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...

MARCY
Yada what?

GEORGE
Yada yada yada...
% At Mickey and Kramer's date.

KAREN
(To Mickey, wearing the shirt Elaine looked at for them) I like your shirt.

MICKEY
Oh, thank you. It's 100% cotton, and some wool.

KRAMER
Well, you too seem to have the same taste.

JULIE
Well I like it, too.

KRAMER
Well I have the same shirt.

MICKEY
Yeah, well I'm wearin' it.

JULIE
I like your shirt too.

KAREN
Oh, so do I.

KRAMER
Oh. (Waiter approaches table)

WAITER
Anything to drink? Some wine, perhaps.

MICKEY
I like Merlot.

KAREN
I love Merlot.

JULIE
I'm crazy about Merlot.

KRAMER
I live for Merlot.

WAITER
We're out of Merlot.
% Cut to the adoption agency.

AGENT
So you, uh, know Betha and Arnie pretty well?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah, yeah.

AGENT
Do you socialize with them often?

ELAINE
Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.

AGENT
Oh.

ELAINE
Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, "Would you SHUT UP?!" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)
% Jerry is in the dental chair when George enters.

GEORGE
Oh, you're in here.

JERRY
What're you doing here?

GEORGE
I knew you had an appointment.

JERRY
Well this is very awkward.

GEORGE
I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool)

JERRY
Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.

GEORGE
Hey, what this thing? Whew!

JERRY
All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)

GEORGE
Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?

JERRY
George...

TIM
Um...

GEORGE
Fine, I'll make an appointment. (He leaves)

TIM
All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? Huh?

JERRY
Hey.

TIM
Those aren't mahtzah balls.

JERRY
Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?

TIM
Why not? I'm Jewish, remember?

JERRY
I know, but...

TIM
Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people for 3000 years.

JERRY
5000.

TIM
5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of flouride.
% Jerry and Elaine at Jerry's apartment.

JERRY
And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.

ELAINE
Why are you so concerned about this?

JERRY
I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)

PHONE
Would you be interested in a subscription to the New York Times?

JERRY
Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)

KRAMER
I don't believe that.

MICKEY
If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we could've figured this whole thing out.

KRAMER
Why were you holding the door open for?

MICKEY
Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man?

KRAMER
Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!

MICKEY
Let's just put they're names in a hat.

KRAMER
I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?

MICKEY
I'm not sure she was my type.

KRAMER
Oh, everybody's your type.

MICKEY
What the hell does that mean?

KRAMER
You've been married three times.

MICKEY
That's it, it's go time! (Charges toward Kramer, only to be held back by Jerry and Elaine)

JERRY
All right, take it easy.

ELAINE
Hey, hey, hey!

KRAMER
Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!

ELAINE
Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.

MICKEY
That's not bad.

KRAMER
All right, so we let the girls decide.

MICKEY
Yeah, why should we knock ourselves out?

KRAMER
Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.

MICKEY
No, no one wears the shirt next time.

KRAMER
That's right, 'cause they already saw it.

MICKEY
We'll look like idiots. (They exit)
% George and Marcy at Monk's.

GEORGE
Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.

MARCY
So what's she doing now?

GEORGE
Yada.

MARCY
Speaking of ex's, my old boyfriend came over late last night, and, yada yada yada, anyway. I'm really tired today.
% Beth and Arnie see Elaine walking down the street.

ELAINE
Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?

ARNIE
Well our adoption application was denied.

ELAINE
Really.

BETH
The adoption agent seems to feel that Arnie has a violent temper.

ELAINE
Oh.

BETH
So we're just asking our friends what they may have said to the adoption agent.

ELAINE
Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.
% Cut to the dentist waiting room.

JERRY
How you doing?

FATHER
I have a discomfort in my molar. (Enter Tim)

TIM
Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? (To Jerry) Father Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. (Exits)

JERRY
Whatley. (Like "Newman")
% At Kramer and Mickey's date, they enter to find the girls already at the table.

KRAMER
What are they doing here?

MICKEY
I told you we should've gotten here a half hour early.

KRAMER
All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?

MICKEY
All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one do you want?

KRAMER
All right, I'll take Julie.

MICKEY
I knew you wanted her. That's who I wanted.

KRAMER
All right, I'll take Karen.

MICKEY
No, no, you think I'm fallin' for that? I'll take Karen.

KRAMER
All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle)
% Jerry's.

JERRY
So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."

ELAINE
You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!

JERRY
Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.

ELAINE
So what're you gonna do?

JERRY
I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.

ELAINE
(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.

JERRY
They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?

ELAINE
Thought it would be nice.

JERRY
Poor Beth.

ELAINE
Hey, Arnie's just as upset.

JERRY
Oh screw him! (George enters)

GEORGE
Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and "yada yada yada, I'm really tired today." You don't think she yada yada'd sex.

ELAINE
(Raising hand) I've yada yada'd sex.

GEORGE
Really?

ELAINE
Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.

JERRY
But you yada yada'd over the best part.

ELAINE
No, I mentioned the bisk.

GEORGE
Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)

KRAMER
Well, I gotta do somethin'.

JERRY
George is already in there.

KRAMER
(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.

JERRY
I thought you were leaning towards Julie.

KRAMER
I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.
% George and Marcy at Monk's.

GEORGE
Well it was a helluva yada yada.

MARCY
He's moving to Seattle. We wanted to say goodbye, I was just getting out of the shower, and yada yada yada--

GEORGE
All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.

MARCY
Okay.

GEORGE
Tell me about the free facial.

MARCY
Okay, well, like I said I was on 3rd Avenue, and I stopped by a large department store.

GEORGE
Which one?

MARCY
Bloomingdale's.

GEORGE
Very good. Go on.

MARCY
Oh, and I stole a Piaget watch.

GEORGE
What's that?

MARCY
And then, I was on such a... high, that I went upstairs to the salon on the fifth floor, and got a massage and facial, and skipped out on the bill.

GEORGE
Shoplifting.

MARCY
Well, what about you? You told me that you were engaged. What was the rest of that? (Pause)
% Jerry at the church approaches a nun.

JERRY
Excuse me, Mother?

NUN
Sister.

JERRY
Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?

NUN
Well not until tomorrow.

JERRY
Hmm, I really need to speak with him.
% Jerry enters confessional, sits down on kneeler. Father Curtis opens sliding door.

FATHER
That's a kneeler.

JERRY
Oh. (Adjusts accordingly)

FATHER
Tell me your sins, my son.

JERRY
Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.

FATHER
That's no sin.

JERRY
Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.

FATHER
And this offends you as a Jewish person.

JERRY
No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.

FATHER
Well.

JERRY
And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.

FATHER
I haven't heard that one.

JERRY
Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, "Those aren't buoys." (Father starts laughing) Father...

FATHER
One second... Well, if it would make you feel better I could speak to Dr. Whatley. I have to go back and have a wisdom teeth removed.

JERRY
You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?

FATHER
Um...

JERRY
Newer magazines.

FATHER
Now if you'll excuse me. (Closes door. George enters confessional.)

GEORGE
Jerry, I gotta talk to you.

Elaine, I have to ask you something. What exactly happened down there?

ELAINE
Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....

ARNIE
All right, shut up!

ELAINE
Again you are telling me to shut up?

ARNIE
What?

ELAINE
You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.

ARNIE
Oh my God. How am I gonna tell Beth?

ELAINE
Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.

ARNIE
All right, just don't screw it up this time! (He exits)

ELAINE
See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.
% At the dentist, Tim is working on Jerry.

JERRY
(In pain) Oh, are you about done?

TIM
I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with newer magazines.

JERRY
Huh?

TIM
Father Curtis told me about your little joke.

JERRY
What about all your Jewish jokes?

TIM
I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my people have been through.

JERRY
The Jews?

TIM
No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate of any profession?

JERRY
Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
% Jerry enters his apartment to see Kramer talking on his phone.

KRAMER
So, I'll uh... all right. (Hangs up)

JERRY
Date with Karen?

KRAMER
No, Julie. She's the one.

JERRY
What happened to Karen?

KRAMER
Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?

JERRY
Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?

KRAMER
Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry.

JERRY
So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.

KRAMER
Those people, listen to yourself.

JERRY
What?

KRAMER
You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.

JERRY
Kramer, he's just a dentist.

KRAMER
Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.

JERRY
I am not an anti-dentite!

KRAMER
You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. "Hey, denty!" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.

JERRY
They do have their own schools!

KRAMER
Yeah!
% At the adoption agency...

ELAINE
One little baby, whatever you have in stock.

AGENT
Miss Benes...

ELAINE
Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.
% Beth enters Jerry's place.

BETH
Jerry, I'm sorry to bother you, but you always said you'd be there for me.

JERRY
Well, what's wrong?

BETH
I'm thinking of leaving Arnie.

JERRY
Talk to me.

BETH
He met with Elaine, and I asked him what happened, and he yada yada'd me. I mean, could he be having an affair?

JERRY
Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.

BETH
But we just got married.

JERRY
Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.

BETH
Why would Elaine do that to me?

JERRY
Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)

MICKEY
Hey Jerry. Where's Kramer? I've got exciting news.

JERRY
I'm kinda in the middle of something.

MICKEY
Karen and I are getting married.

JERRY
Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart.

MICKEY
(To Beth) How many is that for you?

BETH
Two.

MICKEY
You're a lightweight. Come on, honey.
% One week later at the wedding. Elaine is sitting with adoption agent. Jerry enters with Beth.

ELAINE
Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?

JERRY
Beth and Arnie broke up.

ELAINE
So they don't want a baby?

JERRY
(Shaking his head no) Pff.

ELAINE
(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone)

JERRY
Hey, where's Marcy?

GEORGE
She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter)

JERRY
Hey, Kramer, over here.

KRAMER
I just assume not sit next to you.

JERRY
Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.

ELAINE
Nice looking family.

JERRY
Very handsome.

KRAMER
(To Mr. Abbott) How ya doing?

MR. ABBOTT
Hey Kramer.

JULIE
Oh Mickey. Excuse me, I can't take this. (She exits quickly)

JERRY
Hi, Mr. Abbott.

MR. ABBOTT
That's Dr. Abbott, D.D.S. Tim Whatley was one of my students. And if this wasn't my son's wedding day, I'd knock you teeth out you anti-dentite bastard.

BETH
What was that all about?

JERRY
Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.

BETH
Hey, what do you call a doctor who fails out of med school?

JERRY
What?

BETH
A dentist. (They laugh)

JERRY
That's a good one. Dentists.

BETH
Yeah, who needs 'em? Not to mention the Blacks and the Jews. (Jerry fakes a smile)
% A little later.

ELAINE
Where's Beth?

JERRY
She went out to get her head shaved.

FATHER
We are gathered her today to unite this couple in holy... matrimony.

JERRY
Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.

FATHER
Marriage is not an intervention to be entered lightly... Yada yada yada, I pronounce you man and wife. (They kiss, walk toward exit)

KAREN
(To Kramer) I really wanted you.
End.
[Putumayo]
Inside a store full of ethnic merchandise. Elaine is examining some sort of
footwear, while behind the counter Gladys is on the phone.

ELAINE
Uh, excuse me.

GLADYS
Be with you in a minute. (turns her back to Elaine and continues into
phone) No, you shoulda come last night, it was fun.

ELAINE
Uhm, I just have a question.

GLADYS
(into phone) I know, the margaritas in that place are so strong.

ELAINE
(walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.

GLADYS
(into phone) So? What else is goin' on?

ELAINE
(shouts) HEY!!

GLADYS
Listen, I'll call you back. (to Elaine) Yes? What can I do for you?

ELAINE
(tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You, just lost a
customer.
Elaine stalks to the door, but ruins her exit by trying to push open a door she
should pull.
[Valerie's Apartment]
Jerry, pulling on his jacket, and Valerie preparing to leave.

VALERIE
Ready to go? I don't wanna miss the previews.

JERRY
Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut
up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.

VALERIE
I think that I was in that theatre. That, that was really funny.

JERRY
Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.
Valerie heads toward the door. Jerry sits by the phone, lifts the receiver and
prepares to dial. As he does so, he notices button '07' on the speed-dial is
marked 'JERRY'. He looks surprised and pleased together.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry and George stood talking.

GEORGE
So you're on the speed dial?

JERRY
After two dates!

GEORGE
What number?

JERRY
Seven.

GEORGE
Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that
plastic thing with a pen.
The door opens and Kramer enters. He's carrying a couple of folding chairs in
each hand.

KRAMER
Uh, hey buddy.

JERRY
Hey.
Kramer carries the chairs across the room.

KRAMER
It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve
party.

JERRY
You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
Kramer props the chairs up against a wall.

KRAMER
No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told
you about that.

JERRY
Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!

KRAMER
You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep
in front of 'em.
Kramer exits. George has taken one of the chairs, unfolded it, and is sat with
his feet up on the back of the couch, hands behind his head.

GEORGE
Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front
office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.

JERRY
What for?

GEORGE
(smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my
brains.

JERRY
Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?

GEORGE
(thoughtful) I have no idea.
Elaine enters, throws her bag on the table. She's in a bad mood.

ELAINE
Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.

JERRY
I don't mind the Mayans.
Elaine gets another of the folding chairs.

ELAINE
(unfolding chair) You know that store, Putumayo? (sits) I was trying to
buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.
Kramer enters carrying more chairs.

KRAMER
What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis.

ELAINE
No, no, not Putumayo.

KRAMER
No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to
it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan.

GEORGE
(slightly worried) You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about
this lunch.

ELAINE
What'd you have?
Kramer enters again. This time he has a large bunch of multi-coloured balloons
on ribbons. He ties the bunch to Elaine's chair.

KRAMER
Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. (begins to
leave)

JERRY
Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!

KRAMER
(at the door) Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday
balloons.
[Monk's]
George sits in a booth. Opposite him are two guys from the Mets.

MINKLER
George, we'll be blunt. The Mets need somebody to head up scouting, and
we think that someone might be you.

GEORGE
(surprise) Head of scouting?

MOONEY
Interested?

GEORGE
(playing it cool) I'm still here.

MINKLER
Now, unfortunately, league rules prevent us from making you an offer
while you're still under contract.

MOONEY
You understand what we're talking about?

GEORGE
So you're talking...

MINKLER
No, no.

MOONEY
We're *not* talking. We're just, talking.

GEORGE
So, you need me to get fired.

MINKLER
We didn't say that.

MOONEY
We couldn't say that, because even if we did...

MINKLER
...we couldn't say that we said it.

MOONEY
You see what we're saying?

GEORGE
(jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch?

MINKLER
(serious) We didn't say that.
[Valerie's Apartment]
Valerie is sitting by her phone, having just finished some adjustment. Jerry
arrives, obviously a little rushed.

JERRY
Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment.
How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?

VALERIE
(pointedly) Someplace nice this time?

JERRY
Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good
things.

VALERIE
(rising) I don't know, got a two in Zagat's.
Valerie rises and leaves the room. As she goes, Jerry sits beside the phone.

JERRY
Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called.
Jerry presses the '07' button, without looking.

VOICE (O.C.)
Hello?

JERRY
Hello? Who's this?

VOICE (O.C.)
Jane. What number did you dial?
He looks down at the speed-dial and sees button '07' now marked 'JANE', and his
name now next to '09'.

JERRY
Seven?
[Putumayo]
Gladys is behind the counter. Through the window, Elaine can be seen outside.
Elaine bangs on the window to get Gladys' attention.

ELAINE
Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) Cinqo
de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! (waves)
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry and Kramer sit at the table. Jerry reading a newspaper, Kramer with a
clipboard. George is heard outside the door.

GEORGE (O.C.)
(singing) Meet the Mets...
George enters, looking pleased with himself.

GEORGE
...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.

JERRY
Good meeting?

GEORGE
There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite
a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing
is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.

JERRY
You can do that.

GEORGE
Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I
wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got
canned!'

JERRY
So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?

GEORGE
Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my
feet in the soft-serve machine?

KRAMER
You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand?
Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?
Jerry and George give Kramer a long look. Then break to continue their own
conversation.

JERRY
So, George...

GEORGE
Yeah.

JERRY
(rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the
speed-dial.
Jerry moves to the kitchen, with George following.

GEORGE
So?

JERRY
So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.

GEORGE
What, she's ranking you?

JERRY
Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer.

GEORGE
What is a barometer exactly?

KRAMER
It's pronounced thermometer.
Jerry gives another look to Kramer. George raises his eyes. Kramer rises and
comes over to the guys.

KRAMER
You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll
just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup
(judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on a 'mental
phone') getting a call here.

KRAMER
(to Jerry and George) Hey, it's Newman. (to 'mental phone') Hey, how you
doing, Newman?
Jerry begins mouthing 'I'm not here' and making gestures indicating he doesn't
want to talk to Newman.

KRAMER
(to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?
Kramer leans toward Jerry, as if to allow him to use the 'mental phone'. Jerry
throws his arms up in exasperation.
[Valerie's Apartment]
Jerry has just arrived and has presented Valerie with a floral bouquet.

VALERIE
(pleased) Oh, flowers. You didn't have to do that. I mean, the dinner,
and the play, and the hansom cab ride.

JERRY
Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to
Barnes and Noble.

VALERIE
Oh.

JERRY
(resumes) ...you know, make a good impression.

VALERIE
I'm gonna go put these in some water.

JERRY
I like the way you think.
Valerie leaves to the kitchen(?). The moment she's gone, Jerry rushes over to
the phone. He picks it up to read the list of names on the speed-dial, and finds
himself promoted to the '01' button.

JERRY
Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!
[Yankees Boardroom(?)]
Wilhelm and some others are sitting around the big table. George is sitting
down. He's wearing an old-fashioned baseball jersey. On the table in front of
him, he places a large paper bag.

GEORGE
Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride
display case.

WILHELM
Isn't that Babe Ruth's uniform?

GEORGE
Is it? (reaches into bag)
Wilhelm looks disturbed by George's actions.

GEORGE
Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. Ooh,
juicy this time of year.
He wipes strawberry juice from his fingers onto Babe Ruth's jersey.

GEORGE
Gotta get the good ones.
He fetches another over-ripe strawberry from the bag, and drops it onto the
front of the jersey leaving a pulpy stain.

GEORGE
Oh, that's bad. That's bad.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Kramer sits at the table with his clipboard.

KRAMER
So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be
able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?

JERRY
Some of us.

KRAMER
(crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody.
Elaine enters. She is festooned with Mayan goods. All her clothes, bag,
earrings, everything.

JERRY
Hola.

ELAINE
Shove it!

JERRY
What is all this?

ELAINE
I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show
Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates
dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days.

JERRY
Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.

KRAMER
Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.

ELAINE
Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party.
Elaine fishes in her bag for the invite.

KRAMER
Newman?

ELAINE
Yeah.
Elaine hands her invite to Kramer.

KRAMER
(reads) Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!
[Jerry's Car]
Jerry has stopped to pick someone up. A woman climbs into the passenger side.

JERRY
Hi Valerie.
The woman turns to face him.

JERRY
You're not Valerie.

MRS HAMILTON
I'm her step-mother. Drive.
Jerry does as he's told and sets off down the street.

MRS HAMILTON
It's taken me thirteen years to climb up to the top of that
speed-dial, and I don't intend to lose my spot to you.

JERRY
But, I never...

MRS HAMILTON
(threatening) You just stay away from that phone.
[Steinbrenner's Office]
Steinbrenner behind his desk. George crosses the floor from the door.

GEORGE
You wanted to see me, sir?

STEINBRENNER
I heard about what happened at the meeting this morning...
George looks quietly pleased at his imminent dismissal.

GEORGE
Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an
hour.

STEINBRENNER
...and I have to tell you, it's exactly what this organisation
needed.
George looks stunned as he realises he's not going to be fired.

STEINBRENNER
We wanna look to the future, we gotta tear down the past. Babe
Ruth was nothing more than a fat old man, with little-girl legs. And here's
something I just found out recently. He wasn't really a sultan. Ah, what d'you
make of that? Hey, check this out. (he stands to reveal he's wearing baseball
pants) Lou Gehrig's pants. Not a bad fit. (a thought occurs) Hey, you don't
think that nerve disease of his was contagious, do you? Uh, I better take 'em
off. I'm too important to this team. (removes the pants to reveal his boxers)
Big Stein can't be flopping and twitching.
George is further discomfited by the sight of Steinbrenner in his underwear.

STEINBRENNER
Hey, how 'bout some lunch. What're you going for?
[Valerie's Apartment]
Jerry and Valerie are sitting on the couch, eating popcorn.

JERRY
You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your
speed-dial.

VALERIE
You deserve it.

JERRY
But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who
deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.

VALERIE
My stepmother got to you, didn't she?

JERRY
What? No.

VALERIE
Uuh, I can't believe she did this again. That's it! She's off the
speed-dial completely!
Valerie gets up, stalks to the phone and sets about rejigging her speed-dial.

JERRY
Yikes!
[Newman's Apartment]
Newman sits at the table. Kramer has arrived and is holding his invitation.

KRAMER
Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.

NEWMAN
You just got it? Damn, the mail is slow.

KRAMER
(getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party, but you
just had to throw yours on the same day!

NEWMAN
I have done nothing unethical.

KRAMER
Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody
about my party.

NEWMAN
Cancel! (jumps to feet) Think again, longshanks! I started planning this
in nineteen seventy-eight. I put a deposit down on that revolving restaurant
that overlooks Times Square, and I booked Christopher Cross.

KRAMER
(worked up) Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding
chairs, and quite a bit of ice.

NEWMAN
(thoughtful) What kind?

KRAMER
Cubed.

NEWMAN
That's good stuff, and you can never have too much ice. Alright, I'll
tell you what I'll do. You can co-host the party with me, under one condition.
No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.

KRAMER
I gotta invite Jerry. He's my buddy.

NEWMAN
That he may be. But he's outta my life, starting in the year
two-thousand. For me, the next millennium must be, Jerry-free!
[Cab]
Jerry and George in the back of a taxi.

JERRY
How could they not fire you?

GEORGE
Never thought I'd fail at failing.

JERRY
Aw, come on there now.

GEORGE
(depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong.

JERRY
Nonsense. You do everything wrong.

GEORGE
(hopeful) Everything?

JERRY
Everything.

GEORGE
You really think so?

JERRY
Absolutely. I have no confidence in you.

GEORGE
Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and
throw myself right back down again!

JERRY
That's the spirit. You suck!

GEORGE
(pleased) I know.
[Cinqo De Mayo]
Elaine is talking with the saleswoman.

ELAINE
No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive
Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.
Gladys comes out behind the counter.

GLADYS
Do you need some help with something?

ELAINE
(puzzled) You? What're you doing here?

GLADYS
I own this store.

ELAINE
No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs
nervously)

GLADYS
I'm Gladys Mayo.
Realisation dawns for Elaine. She begins to leave, slowly.

ELAINE
Ah, this really sticks in my craw.
[Mrs Hamilton's Apartment]
Jerry and Mrs Hamilton sitting on the couch. Mrs Hamilton is pouring out a
couple of glasses of wine.

JERRY
Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched
things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?

MRS HAMILTON
I'm sure she'll be along. (handing over a glass) Have some wine,
Jerome.

JERRY
Okay.
Mrs Hamilton leans back on the couch beside Jerry. She's sitting uncomfortably
close to Jerry, and as she speaks she puts an arm along the top of the couch
behind Jerry. (To cut it short, this scene plays pretty close to the early
Dustin Hoffman/Anne Bancroft scenes in The Graduate.)

MRS HAMILTON
You know Jerome, I can understand what Valerie sees in you. So
attractive, so strong, so comedic.

JERRY
Uh, good.

MRS HAMILTON
Jerome, I have a deliciously naughty idea.

JERRY
(nervous) What?

MRS HAMILTON
Why don't I put you on my speed-dial?

JERRY
I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...

MRS HAMILTON
Don't be such a child, Jerome. How's number three sound?
Jerry leaps to his feet as Mrs Hamilton goes for her phone.

JERRY
Valerie's not coming over, is she?
Mrs Hamilton is programming her phone.

MRS HAMILTON
Seven, four...

JERRY
No...

MRS HAMILTON
Two...

JERRY
Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?

MRS HAMILTON
I won't tell if you don't.

JERRY
(leaving hurriedly) Wuhh...
[Kramer's Apartment]
Kramer is asleep, but his sleep is fitful. He tosses and turns.

KRAMER
Jerry... Newman... Two-thousand...
Kramer suddenly sits bolt upright.

KRAMER
(yells) Newmanniun!!
He reaches over to his bedside table and picks up a photograph. It's of himself
and Jerry at a previous party, looking happy together.

KRAMER
(whimper) Jerry?
Kramer clutches the photo to his chest, and flops back onto the mattress.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry sits on his couch, watching baseball on TV. Steve Koren is commentating.

KOREN (O.C.)
Alright, Yankees, two. Orioles, nothing. Wait a minute! A short
stocky bald man is streaking across the field.

JERRY
Oh my God, George!

KOREN (O.C.)
Check that. He's not streaking. He's wearing a flesh-tone
body-stocking. Apparently, he's a bit bashful, and oddly, no-one seems upset.
Kramer enters.

JERRY
Kramer, look, it's George.

KOREN (O.C.)
Everyone loves him.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah, I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen, Jerry, I can't let
you come to my New Year's party.

JERRY
(neutral) Fine.

KRAMER
(agitated) I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the
invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!

JERRY
(neutral) No problem.

KRAMER
(swung by Jerry's argument) You're right. I won't do it without you. I
feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.
Elaine enters.

KRAMER
(pleading) Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.

ELAINE
(neutral) Okay.

KRAMER
No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and
Jerry.

ELAINE
(neutral) Fine.

KRAMER
(frustrated shout) Oh come on!!

ELAINE
(neutral) Alright.

KRAMER
(triumph) Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh.
(claps hands) Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I
don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.
Kramer heads out the door.

ELAINE
(following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do
you still have that pricing-gun?

KRAMER
Yeah.

ELAINE
Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.

KRAMER
Can do.
Kramer leaves to his apartment. Elaine begins to follow.

JERRY
What're you doing with a pricing-gun?

ELAINE
That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over
ninety-nine cents.
Elaine leaves and shuts the door.

JERRY
(to himself) Still a rip-off.
The phone rings. Jerry picks up.

JERRY
Hello?
From here on, the scene is presented in a split-screen format, with Valerie and
Mrs Hamilton in their respective apartments, sharing the screen with Jerry as
appropriate.

VALERIE
Jerry, I was just at my stepmom's house, and I saw that you were on her
speed-dial.

JERRY
Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
There is a beep on Jerry's phone as another call comes in.

JERRY
Hold on a second.
Jerry clicks the doofer to answer the other call.

JERRY
Hello?

MRS HAMILTON
(seductive) Hi Jerome.

JERRY
Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other
line. Just a second.
Jerry clicks.

JERRY
Hello?

VALERIE
That's her on the other line, isn't it?

JERRY
Well...

VALERIE
Tell her I don't want you on her speed-dial.

JERRY
Hang on.
Jerry clicks.

JERRY
She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this
thing.

MRS HAMILTON
I won't, until she puts me back on hers.

JERRY
Hang on.
Jerry clicks.

JERRY
She wants to be back on yours.

VALERIE
Fine. But only if you're off hers.

JERRY
Hang on.
Jerry clicks.

JERRY
Fine, if I'm off yours.

VALERIE
No, still me.

JERRY
Sorry. Hang on.
Jerry clicks.

JERRY
Fine, if I'm off yours.

MRS HAMILTON
I won't do it. It's my speed-dial, and I don't trust her.

JERRY
Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.

MRS HAMILTON
(conspiratorial) Alright. I'll hide you in one of the emergency
buttons.

JERRY
(hurried) Great, bye.
Jerry clicks.

JERRY
She said she'll do it.

VALERIE
Great.
There's another beep, as another call comes in.

JERRY
Hang on.
Jerry clicks.

JERRY
Hello?
[Yankee Stadium]
George is at a public telephone, wearing the flesh-tone body-stocking and
looking thoroughly dejected.

GEORGE
Jerry. I can't get fired.
A passing fan spots him.

FAN
Hey, body-suit man. 's up?
He slaps palms with George, who doesn't look especially pleased by the
attention. The fan points out George to more fans.

FAN
(pointing) Hey, body-suit man.
The fans gather round, making positive noises. George looks resigned to his
minor celebrity.
[Putumayo]
Gladys is behind the counter. Outside the door, Elaine peers in for a second
before she moves back out of sight. Then, a be-suited Kramer is pushed into
sight. He enters the store, smoking a cigar.

KRAMER
Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh,
looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest
millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the
feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh,
gritty-gritty.
He notices a bowl of chips beside the register and helps himself to some.

GLADYS
Well, lemme show you what we have.

KRAMER
Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.

KRAMER
(re the chips) Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?

GLADYS
Yeah.

KRAMER
Hmm-mmm.
Kramer strolls over to a rack and grabs a selection of a half-dozen items. He
then heads for the changing room.

GLADYS
Some of those are women's clothes.

KRAMER
Oh, not a problem.
He pulls the curtain shut. The sound of a pricing gun can be heard. The clicking
goes on for a couple of seconds, and then the gun is dropped. It lands by
Kramer's feet and breaks, Kramer then exacerbates his problem by kicking the gun
as he tries to retrieve it.
[Yankee's Parking Lot]
George is driving his car in a circle in the parking lot. Trailing behind the
car, on a rope, is a trophy which bounces and clatters on the tarmac. George is
leaning out of the car window, with a megaphone.

GEORGE
Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean
nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza.
I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.
[Putumayo]
Gladys is still behind the counter. Valerie and Mrs Hamilton are browsing the
racks. Elaine enters and, holding her hand up to hide her face, she walks over
to the changing room, pulls back the curtain and enters.

KRAMER
L'Occupado.

ELAINE
Come on, what is taking you so long?

KRAMER
Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.

ELAINE
Plan B? There is no plan B.

KRAMER
(holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single
garment in the store.

ELAINE
What?!

KRAMER
They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes
won't last five years without 'em.

ELAINE
That's not gonna do anything.

KRAMER
Patience.

ELAINE
Alright. Forget it!

KRAMER
What?

ELAINE
You have screwed me again, Pennypacker!
Elaine leaves, hurrying through the store with her face shielded again.

GLADYS
Ladies, care for some chips?

KRAMER
(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do.
He takes a chip and dips it. As he loads the chip with the dip, a sachet of
dessicate falls from his sleeve into the dip. He doesn't notice, and after
consuming the chip he deposits the bundle of clothing onto the counter.

KRAMER
Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a
rollercoaster instead.
Kramer leaves. Mrs Hamilton comes over to the counter, takes a chip, dips it
into the dessicate-laced dip and eats it.
[Steinbrenner's Office]
George stands before Steinbrenner's desk, in his shirt-sleeves, nonchalantly
eating something. He occasionally shrugs at Steinbrenner's remarks.

STEINBRENNER
I heard what you did in the parking lot, big boy, and it is
in-excuse-a-bull. You personally insulted me, my staff... I cannot believe that
you, body-suit man, could perpetrate such a disloyalty. Breaks my heart to say
it... Oh, who am I kidding? I love it. You're fi...
George looks expectant, as Steinbrenner reaches this point. Suddenly, Mr Wilhelm
enters the office.

WILHELM
Wait, wait, Mr Steinbrenner. George doesn't deserve any of the blame
for what happened in the parking lot today, sir. If there's anyone to blame
here, it's me.
George stares at Wilhelm in disbelief.

STEINBRENNER
What're you talking about, Wilhelm. You popping pills? You got the
crazies again?

WILHELM
No, no. No, no, sir. I ordered George to drive around insulting people
today. Because I'm tired of all your macho head games.

GEORGE
(agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!

STEINBRENNER
Macho head games?

WILHELM
(puts arm round George's shoulder) He's just being loyal to me, sir.

STEINBRENNER
Wilhelm, you're fired. I owe you an apology, body-suit man. Streak
on. (rising) Now, if you gentlemen'll excuse me, I'm not going to the game
today, I'm gonna go outside and scalp some tickets. (heads toward the door)
Owner's box, that's gotta bring in forty bucks, no problem.

GEORGE
Mr Wilhelm, what was that?!

WILHELM
I wanted to get fired. George, you are looking at the new head scout of
the New York Mets.
Wilhelm walks away toward the door, leaving George looking crushed.

WILHELM
(singing) Meet the Mets, meet the Mets. Come right out and greet the
Mets.
[Jerry's Apartment]

KRAMER
I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates,
those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.

JERRY
She never sees the big picture.
There's a knock at the door. Jerry opens it to reveal Newman.

JERRY
Hello, Newman!

NEWMAN
Hello Jerry. (to Kramer) What did you say to Elaine? I just got her
cancellation in the mail.

KRAMER
Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.

NEWMAN
Well, it's her mistake. Because she is going to miss the party of a
lifetime.

KRAMER
Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm
and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.

NEWMAN
Alright. Come back to my party, please.

KRAMER
Jerry too, of course.

NEWMAN
(reluctant) You don't wanna do your... act, or anything, do you?

JERRY
No.

NEWMAN
Alright then, I guess I can accept a little Jerry, if it gets me a
(suggestive) lot of Elaine.
Jerry pulls a disgusted face.

KRAMER
Deal?

NEWMAN
To the Newmanniun! (holds out his hand)

KRAMER
(grasps Newman's hand) To the Kramennium.
Kramer and Newman move to the door to leave. Newman stops as Jerry speaks to
him, and Kramer exits to his apartment.

JERRY
By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you
book it for the millennium New Year?

NEWMAN
(smug) As a matter of fact, I did.

JERRY
Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no
year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one.
Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
Newman absorbs the logic of Jerry's argument. His face twitches as he realises
his error.

JERRY
Aww!
Newman makes a noise redolent of his frustration - a sort of half-strangulated
nasal squeak. He then waddles away after Kramer.
[Mrs Hamilton's Apartment]
Valerie and Mrs Hamilton sit on the couch. Mrs Hamilton looks nauseous.

MRS HAMILTON
I don't feel well at all. I feel all dried-out inside.

VALERIE
I'll call for help.
She picks up the phone and pushes a button marked 'Poison Control'.
[Mrs Hamilton's Apartment/Jerry's Apartment]

JERRY
Hello?

VALERIE
Who's this?

JERRY
It's Jerry. Who's this?

VALERIE
Uh, it's Valerie.

JERRY
Oh, hi Valerie. What's up?

VALERIE
I'll tell you what's up. My stepmother is violently ill, so I hit the
button for poison control and I get you!

JERRY
Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!
Valerie hangs up the phone.

JERRY
Hello?
End.
Jerry and George walking down the street.

JERRY
Hang on just let me pick up a paper.

MAN
Excuse me. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?

GEORGE
Yeah. No problem.

JERRY
Let's go.

GEORGE
Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag.

JERRY
For how long?

GEORGE
I'm sure he'll be back in a second.

JERRY
Come on.

GEORGE
Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?

MAN 2
Why? So I can stand here like an idiot not knowing if you'll ever come back?
Jerry starts to leave.

GEORGE
Where are you going?

JERRY
I'm going to be this guy's friend.
(Commercial)
Jerry and George at Monk's.

JERRY
New clothes?

GEORGE
Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns to a man) Can I borrow your menu?

JERRY
Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!

GEORGE
The guy never came back.

JERRY
He asked you to watch them not wear them.

GEORGE
I'm still watching them.

JERRY
You look like a tourist.

GEORGE
All right, let me ask you something: When do you start to worry about ear hair?

JERRY
When you hear like a soft russeling.

GEORGE
It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this: Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.

JERRY
Oh right, the new job, how is it?

GEORGE
I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.

JERRY
So who's the new you?

GEORGE
They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.

JERRY
Oh hi Alex.

ALEX
I'm sorry I'm late. Have you ordered yet?

JERRY
No.

ALEX
I'll be right back.

GEORGE
Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?

JERRY
Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.

GEORGE
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Kramer in Jerry's apartment. Kramer searches in Jerry's couch for something and picks it up. Elaine enters. Kramer hurriedly puts the cushions back on the couch. (What was he looking for anyway? Anything specific?)

KRAMER
Hey.

ELAINE
Hey.

KRAMER
Hi.

ELAINE
Where's Jerry?

KRAMER
Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?

ELAINE
No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.

KRAMER
Well let's sit down.

ELAINE
Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?

KRAMER
Vaguely.

ELAINE
Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.

KRAMER
You put my life's stories in his autobiography?

ELAINE
Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.

KRAMER
Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.

ELAINE
He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.

KRAMER
Waldenbooks? That's a major chain huh.
Kramer enters the bathroom.

KRAMER
He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks.

JERRY
(yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.

KRAMER
All right, let's go.
At Waldenbooks.

ELAINE
Mr. Lippman, how are you?

MR LIPPMAN
Well I'm not bad. Not bad.

ELAINE
What are you doing here?

MR LIPPMAN
I work for Pundant Publishishing. This is our book.

ELAINE
Oh.

MR LIPPMAN
If you can call it that. Why is it every half-wit and sitcom star has his own book out now?

KRAMER
Hey buddy. Remember me?

MR PETERMAN
You're that gangly fellow we bought the stories from.

KRAMER
Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?

WOMAN
Who are you?

KRAMER
I'm the real Peterman.

MR PETERMAN
All right playtime's over.

KRAMER
Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.

WOMAN
I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.

ELAINE
That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.

MR LIPPMAN
So you just eat the tops.

ELAINE
Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
Two men forcefully pick Kramer up and push him out of the store.

KRAMER
I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.
George is walking down the street looking down at his map. He is bumping into people.

MAN 1
Try looking up hayseed.

MAN 2
You wanna sightsee? Get on a bus.

MARY ANNE
Please don't think all New Yorkers are so rude.

GEORGE
Well actually I'm...

MARY ANNE
I'm Mary Anne. I work for the New York Visitor's Center. Where are you visiting from?

GEORGE
Little Rock, Arkensas.

MARY ANNE
Ooh.
Jerry is in his bathroom shaving. He thinks. He tilts the mirror down.

JERRY
Hmm. That looks new.
He thinks some more. He picks up his razor.

KRAMER
So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.

JERRY
(uncomfortably) Yeah that's too bad.

KRAMER
What's the matter with you?

JERRY
(uncomfortably) Nothing.

KRAMER
No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.

JERRY
I did something stupid.

KRAMER
What did you do?

JERRY
Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone.

KRAMER
Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.

JERRY
Well women do it.

KRAMER
(high pitched voice) "Well women do it." I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around the town square.

JERRY
Well what am I going to tell Alex?

KRAMER
Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?

JERRY
Um hum.
George enters

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry shaved his chest.

JERRY
Hey!

KRAMER
I forgot. Wait. Never mind.
Jerry and Alex walking.

ALEX
How about the beach this weekend?

JERRY
You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...

ALEX
All right. All right. Wow is that a Mexican Hairless? Oh, I love those. Ooh, Hairless. This is where it's at. It's so much smoother and cleaner.

JERRY
Really?
Elaine walks into a muffin shop.

ELAINE
"Top of the Muffin to you!"?

MR. LIPPMAN
Top of the muffin to you. Elaine!

ELAINE
Mr Lippman?
George and Jerry at Jerry's apartment.

JERRY
So you're pretending to be a tourist?

GEORGE
It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup

JERRY
How do you explain your apartment?

GEORGE
I got a hotel room.

JERRY
you moved into a hotel?

GEORGE
Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?

JERRY
So get this: we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.

GEORGE
So?

JERRY
So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.

GEORGE
Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?

JERRY
Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.
Kramer is in a school bus. He honks his horn. Camera shot down on the bus.

KRAMER
(yelling up at Jerry) Hey Jerry.
Jerry pulls up the blinds on his upstairs window and looks down.

KRAMER
(yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.

GEORGE
Reality tour?

JERRY
The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
Elaine at the muffin shop.

ELAINE
This was my idea you stole my idea.

MR. LIPPMAN
Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in the air.

ELAINE
Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.

MR. LIPPMAN
You want a muffin or not?

ELAINE
Peach.
Gerge and Mary Anne at Monks.

MARY ANNE
So I notice you don't have much of an accent.

GEORGE
Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.

MARY ANNE
Look george, I'm really enjoying spending time with you but I'm not sure this is going to work out. At some point you're going back to your job at Tyler Chicken and your three-legged dog Willie.

GEORGE
Willie. Yeah.

MARY ANNE
And I'm still going to be here.

GEORGE
Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?

MARY ANNE
(laughs) George, no offense. But this city would eat you alive.
(Commercial)

JERRY
You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.

GEORGE
Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.

JERRY
What is it she think you can't do?

GEORGE
Find a job. Get an apartment.

JERRY
How did you do those things?

GEORGE
Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.

JERRY
Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?

KRAMER
Here you go, here you go, check it out.

JERRY
"The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.

KRAMER
Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.

JERRY
Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.

KRAMER
I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.

GEORGE
What's desert?

KRAMER
Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.

GEORGE
He eats those?

KRAMER
No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.

GEORGE
I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.

KRAMER
Talk to me.

GEORGE
But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.

KRAMER
Understand?

JERRY
Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.
Elaine and Mr. Lippman at Monk's.

MR. LIPPMAN
Elaine. I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin tops.

ELAINE
So? What do you want me to do about it?

MR. LIPPMAN
You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing wrong.

ELAINE
Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...

MR. LIPPMAN
What if I cut you in for 30% of the profits?

ELAINE
Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.

MR. LIPPMAN
Ah. (takes a bite of the top.) Mmmmm. Ah hah?

ELAINE
Yeah.

MR. LIPPMAN
So what do we with the bottoms?

ELAINE
I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.

MR. LIPPMAN
That's a good idea.

ELAINE
And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not "Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"

MR. LIPPMAN
No. No. It is.
At Jerry's apartment.

KRAMER
Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?

JERRY
What? Can't I get a moment's peace?

KRAMER
What are you doing to yourself?
Jerry walks into camera view with his chest covered with shaving cream.

JERRY
I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.

KRAMER
You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.

JERRY
Oh that's an old wives tale.

KRAMER
Is it? Look at this.
Kramer walks off-screen and opens his shirt. On-screen, Jerry reels from the sight.

KRAMER
(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.

JERRY
Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.

KRAMER
Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?
Elain at the muffin shop.

ELAINE
Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.
Lippman Oh, Rubin, get me another tray of lowfat cranberry.

REBECCA
Excuse me, I'm Rebecca Demore from the homeless shelter.

ELAINE
Oh, hi.

REBECCA
Are you the ones leaveing the muffing pieces behind our shelter?

ELAINE
You been enjoying them?

REBECCA
They're just stumps.

ELAINE
Well they're perfectly edible.

REBECCA
Oh, so you just assume that the homeless will eat them, they'll eat anything?

MR. LIPPMAN
No no, we just thought...

REBECCA
I know what you thought. They don't have homes, they don't have jobs, what do they need the top of a muffin for? They're lucky to get the stumps.

ELAINE
If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.

REBECCA
The homeless don't like them.

ELAINE
Fine.

REBECCA
We've never gotten so many complaints. Every two minutes, "Where is the top of this muffin? Who ate the rest of this?"

ELAINE
We were just trying to help.

REBECCA
Why don't you just drop off some chicken skins and lobster shells.

ELAINE
I think I might.
Mary Anne and George at George's "new" apartment.

MARY ANNE
I can't believe you found something so quickly. How much you pay?

GEORGE
$2300.

MARY ANNE
Ouch. A month?

GEORGE
Yeah.

MARY ANNE
Well, guess that's all right for now, but if you say here for more than a few months, you're a real sucker.

GEORGE
Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.

MARY ANNE
Yeah. We should let this place air out anyway. It smells like the last tenant had monkeys or something.
Mary Anne exits. George sniffs his armpit.
On Kramer's bus.

KRAMER
Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.

WOMAN
Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic.

KRAMER
(over the speaker) Well that's your opinion.

MAN 1
Can I have another Three Musketeers? They're rather small.

KRAMER
Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.

MAN 2
Who's Newman?

MAN 3
Who cares.

MAN 4
Hey fake Peterman, let me off. I'm nautious.

MAN 1
Can I have his candy bar?

KRAMER
Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time.
Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.
At Jerry's apartment.

JERRY
Why do I have to go on the tour?

KRAMER
Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.
Elaine enters

JERRY
Hey, how's business?

ELAINE
Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.

KRAMER
All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.

ELAINE
Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?

KRAMER
Yeah.

ELAINE
You got any room on that thing?

KRAMER
Yeah there are a few seats still available.

ELAINE
Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.

KRAMER
Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.

ELAINE
No they don't.

KRAMER
Are they war veterans?
Elaine looks at him confused.
In George's office.

MARY ANNE
Wow this is your office.

MR. STEINBRENNER
Woah. Hello. Sorry George, didn't know you got a girl in here. Give me a signal on the doornob like a necktie or a sock or something. Come on George, help me out.

MARY ANNE
Mr. Steinbrenner, I would like to thank you for taking a chance on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken like our boy George here.

MR. STEINBRENNER
Hen supervisor from Tyler Chicken?

GEORGE
Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave)

MR. STEINBRENNER
Wait a minute George.

GEORGE
Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.

MR. STEINBRENNER
Moonlighting for Tyler Chicken. Pretty impressive George. Days with the New York Yankees and nights in Arkensas with a top flight bird outlet. And a hen supervisor to boot. I am blown. Bloooown away. Blown George. (vibration in the "o"'s) Bloooooooooooooooooooown.
On Kramer's bus.

ALEX
You know when you make a pizza bagel, you really shouldn't use cinnimon rasin.

JERRY
You also shouldn't use a donut.
Kramer gets on the bus. He starts the tape player playing banjo music.

KRAMER
All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...

TAPE PLAYER
Turn music off.

JERRY
Can we just go?

KRAMER
And go we will.

MAN
What is this, a pizza-pound cake?

KRAMER
We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.

MAN 2
We're going to a garbage dump?

KRAMER
And we're off.

JERRY
You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.
Mr. Steinbrenner is sitting at his desk on the phone with the manager at Tyler chicken who is also sitting at his desk.

MR. STEINBRENNER
(the back of his head to the camera) John Tyler? George Steinbreener here. I want to talk about George Castanza. I understand he's been dividing his time between us and you. I cannot have that.

JOHN TYLER
(the back of his head also to the camera) Well I don't know who he is but if you want him that bad I'm not giving him up that easily.

MR. STEINBRENNER
Oh is that so. Playing a little hardball huh Jonnyboy?

JOHN TYLER
How about this. You give me Castanza, I convert your concessions to all chicken no charge. Instead of hot dogs, chicken dogs. Instead of pretzels, chicken twists. Instead of beer, alcoholic chicken.

MR. STEINBRENNER
How do you make that alcoholic chicken?

JOHN TYLER
Let if ferment, just like everything else.

MR. STEINBRENNER
That stuff sounds great. All right. I'll have Costanza on the next bus.
Kramer at a garbage dump carrying a garbage bag.

MAN
Hey hey hey hey hey. Where do you think you're going?

KRAMER
I was going to dump this.

MAN
It doesn't look like garbage.

KRAMER
Well it's muffin stumps

MAN
Where are the muffin tops?

KRAMER
This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.

MAN
Can't do it.

KRAMER
Is this a joke?

MAN
That's what I'd like to know about it.

ALEX
You have a pretty heavy beard, don't you?

JERRY
What's that?

ALEX
Well look it's almost time for you to shave again.

JERRY
Oh. Yeah.

KRAMER
(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs.
Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.

MAN
Where are we going?

KRAMER
(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions.
Banjo music plays as they look for garbage dumps.
Next scene. Kramer argues with someone at a dump.
Next scene. A man vomits on the floor.
Next scene. Kramer is driving. He is sleepy. His head nods down onto the horn. The horn blows. Startled, Kramer sits back up.
Banjo music finishes.

WAITRESS
So, the New York Yankees traded you for a bunch of Tyler chicken.

GEORGE
Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.

MAN
Hey, aren't you the guy I asked to watch my clothes?

GEORGE
What clothes?

MAN
These clothes. The ones you're wearing.
On Kramer's bus.

JERRY
(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.

KRAMER
Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.

JERRY
I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.
Kramer gets off the bus, carrying a garbage bag.
Eerie music is playing. Jerry looks out the bus window at a full moon. A dog starts barking.

JERRY
I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.

KRAMER
I don't know where the tops are.
Jerry runs past Kramer and another person. Eerie music still playing.

KRAMER
Jerry what's the matter?
In slow motion Jerry runs into the woods. At normal speed he runs behind a tree. Camera shot down on him as he starts scratching his chest.

JERRY
(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
(Commercial)

BARTENDER
Hey, you looking for George?

MARY ANNE
Yeah.

BARTENDER
He's been in the bathroom awhile. You might want to check on him.

GEORGE
(talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.

MARY ANNE
I told you this city would eat you alive.
At the muffin shop.

MR. LIPPMAN
What is this guy again?

ELAINE
They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
Newman enters.

NEWMAN
Hello Elaine. Where are they?

ELAINE
In the back.

NEWMAN
All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.

MR. LIPPMAN
What is going on here?

NEWMAN
If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, we have a situation here and time is of the essence.
Newman goes to the back room with the muffin stumps and sets down a cooler and an empty glass. From the cooler he takes out 4 bottles of milk and sets them down.

HE BITES INTO A STUMP, THEN TAKES A DRINK OF MILK FROM THE GLASS. (CONTINUITY ERROR
he never actually poured the glass of milk.) He swishes the muffin and the milk together and swollows. He takes another stump.
End.
[George and Jerry at a caf terrace] 
(Missing the beginning.) 

JERRY
Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series. 

GEORGE
I got to give the players most of the credit for that. 

JERRY
Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses. 

GEORGE
No, I don't know who was doing that. 

JERRY
So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did? 

GEORGE
They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe. 
[Waitress (Lanette) comes with drinks] 

LANETTE
Here you go. Your latt, your cappuccino. 
[Waitress leaves] 

JERRY
Maybe I should ask her out? 

GEORGE
She is a good waitress. 

JERRY
That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's. 

GEORGE
You're going to the Tony's? 

JERRY
Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets. 

GEORGE
Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?' 

JERRY
They're musicians. That's not a joke. 

GEORGE
It's a funny observation. 
[George reads a letter] 

GEORGE
Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing. 

JERRY
They did it for three years. What's another few months. 

GEORGE
I'm really going to do something with these three months. 

JERRY
Like what? 

GEORGE
I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order. 

JERRY
I've always wanted to do that... 

GEORGE
I'm gonna play frolf. 

JERRY
You mean golf? 

GEORGE
Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this: The Summer
of George! 
[ A bee comes and George has to runaway to inside] 
 
[Elaine's office. She and two co-workers are chatting in a corridor.] 

ELAINE
...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him. 
[A woman comes walking by, with her hands hanging still besides her.] 

ELAINE
Who's that? 

DUGAN
That's Sam, the new girl in the counting. 

WALTER
What's with her arms? They just hang like salamis. 

DUGAN
She walks like orangutan. 

ELAINE
Better call the zoo. 

DUGAN
Reer... 

ELAINE
What? 

WALTER
ssssss... 

DUGAN
Cat-ty... 
 
[Jerry's apartment. Jerry and Elaine. George is watching TV.] 

ELAINE
It's like she's carrying invisible suitcases. 

JERRY
Like this? [imitates the walk] 

ELAINE
Yes, exactly. 

JERRY
That's so strange. 

ELAINE
Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard. 

JERRY
Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10? 

ELAINE
That is so stupid. 

JERRY
Reer. 

GEORGE
Hey, 'The White Shadow' is on... 

JERRY
Boy, your really packing it all in. 

GEORGE
Jerry, my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today. 

JERRY
Like what? 

GEORGE
I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it. 
[Kramer enters wearing a bathrobe] 

KRAMER
Hey Jerry, you got any Tums? 

JERRY
Stomach ache? 

KRAMER
I drank too much water in the shower. 

JERRY
Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's. 

GEORGE
Shadow! 

KRAMER
Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy. 

ELAINE
You're going to the Tony's too? 

KRAMER
Roger that. 

JERRY
Where are you sitting? 

KRAMER
Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back. 

ELAINE
How did you get that job? 

KRAMER
Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy. 

JERRY
What academy? 

KRAMER
Well, he didn't say [leaves]. 
 
[Jerry comes to pick up Lanette] 

LANETTE
Hi! 

JERRY
Hi! 

LANETTE
Nice tuxedo. 

JERRY
Thanks, it's a breakaway. 

LANETTE
Should we go? 

JERRY
Absolutely. 

LANETTE
Lyle, were going! Jerry, this is Lyle. 

LYLE
Hey, how you doing? 

JERRY
Ok... 
[Lyle and Lanette kiss] 

LANETTE
Bye. 

LYLE
Have a good time. 

JERRY
Thanks, Lyle... 
 
[At the Tony's. Kramer is looking a place to fill. One man stands up.] 

KRAMER
Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered. 
[man tries to button his jacket and Kramer squeezes to his seat] 

KRAMER
I'll just squeeze in... 

MAN
What are you doing? 

KRAMER
My job. What are you doing? 
[Kramer looks at the woman next to him] 

KRAMER
You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do. 
[Same time Jerry and the waitress are sitting elsewhere.] 

JERRY
So, you and Lyle are roommates? 

LANETTE
No. 

JERRY
Gay? 

LANETTE
What? 

JERRY
Is he gay? 

LANETTE
No. 

JERRY
Are you sure? 

LANETTE
I think I would know. 

JERRY TO HIMSELF
This is a new one. 

KRAMER TO WOMAN NEXT TO HIM
Pemmican turkey? Come on take a bite...well more for me. 
[Kramer takes a bite and hits the man in front of him in the head. Then points the blame to lady next to him.] 

ANNOUNCER
...and the best musical award goes to: Scarsdale surprise! 
[People around Kramer stand up and roll on to the stage taking Kramer with them.] 
[George is at home watching the show on TV and takes a soda out of his new recliner.] 

GEORGE
Kramer? 
[TV shows the producers and Kramer accepting the award on stage.] 

MR. GRAHAM ON TV
Thank you and God bless you all. This has truly been a Scarsdale surprise! 
 
[At Monk's. Elaine and Sam.] 

SAM
Elaine, am I crazy? I just get the feeling that Dugan and the others are making fun of me all the time. 

ELAINE
Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk. 

SAM
My arms? 

ELAINE
You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman. 

SAM
I a caveman? 

ELAINE
No no no no, it's just... 

SAM
Everybody told what a catty shrude you are. Your horrible! 
 
[5A. Jerry and George.] 

GEORGE
She had a dude? 

JERRY
Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude. 

GEORGE
How do you know it was her dude? 

JERRY
What do you think it could've been just some dude? 

GEORGE
Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen. 

JERRY
I reckon. 

GEORGE
Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just
some dude. 

JERRY
Dude! 
[They make a high five.] 

GEORGE
All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap. 

JERRY
It's 10:30 in the morning? 

GEORGE
I tell you; I'm wiped. 

JERRY
So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing? 

GEORGE
De-compressing. 
[Kramer enters wearing a tuxedo and carrying a Tony statue.] 

KRAMER
Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you. 

JERRY
You didn't give that thing back? 

KRAMER
Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win. 

JERRY
That's because you didn't win. 

GEORGE
'Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder. 

KRAMER
Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch! 

JERRY
You haven't even seen it. 

KRAMER
Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's! 

GEORGE
What, Minelli's!?! 

KRAMER
No. 
 
[Elaine's office. She is at her desk talking to Sam.] 

ELAINE
Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day. 

SAM
No, don't apologize Elaine. I was thinking that maybe I should swing my arms a little bit more. 

ELAINE
See, yeah, that's all I was saying. 

SAM
How's this [Sam hits a pen case out of the table], or this [swings a paper holder of the table and starts to clear the table left and right]. 

ELAINE
Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it... 
 
[Jerry is picking up Lanette again. She opens the door wearing a towel.] 

JERRY
Hi! 

LANETTE
Sorry, I'm running late. I just lost track of time. 

JERRY
No rush. 
[Lyle walks by wearing a towel.] 

LYLE
Hey, Jerry! What's up? 

JERRY TO HIMSELF
I have absolutely no idea. 
 
[5A. Jerry is on the phone with George who is at home.] 
(missing the beginning) 

JERRY
..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged! 
[Kramer comes in with the Tony.] 

GEORGE
Who's that? 

JERRY
It's Kramer. 

GEORGE
Hey Kramer. 

JERRY
George says hi. 

KRAMER SHOUTS TO THE TELEPHONE
Hi George! 

GEORGE
How's that Tony? 

JERRY
Why don't you just come over? 

GEORGE
Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now? 

JERRY
He's looking on to fridgerator. 

GEORGE
Kramer. Anything good in there? Any Popsicles? 

JERRY
I can't do this. 

KRAMER
So, what's George doing? 

JERRY
He's not doing anything. Goodbye! 

KRAMER
So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go? 

JERRY
Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's? 

KRAMER
The Tony is taking me to Sardi's. 
[Knock on the door. Jerry opens and it's Lanette.] 

JERRY
Oh, hello. 

KRAMER
I'm going. 

LANETTE
Congratulations! 

KRAMER
Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone... 

JERRY
All right, all right. 
[Phone rings and Jerry answers.] 

JERRY
I said no! [hangs up the phone.] 

LANETTE
Jerry, I just want to let you know; Lyle and I are completely over. I'd rather be with you. 

JERRY
Just me? No dudes or fellas? 

LANETTE
What you think? 

JERRY
I can start right away. 
[Phone rings again.] 

JERRY
But not here. [They leave.] 

JERRY'S ANSWERING MACHINE
'I'm not here, leave a message.' 

GEORGE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE
Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone. 
 
[At Sardi's. Kramer is sitting with a group of people.] 

KRAMER
...so I said to him: Arthur, Artie come on, why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. That's what people want to see. 

MR. GRAHAM
Mr. Kramer, my name is Lewis Maxton Graham. I'm one of the producers of 'Scarsdale surprise'. 

KRAMER
Hey, eh, Lew! 

MR. GRAHAM
We need to talk. 
 
[Elaine is talking to Peterman at her office.] 

PETERMAN
Elaine, what did you want to talk me about? 

ELAINE
This. My office. Sam trashed my office. 

PETERMAN
Well, I see what's going on in here. I am smack dab in the middle of a good old fashioned cat fight. 

ELAINE
Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms. 

PETERMAN
Woof! 

ELAINE
Do you mean "reer?" 

PETERMEN
Yes, that's the one! Good day Elaine. [Leaves.] 

ELAINE
Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! [Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing] Crazy for feelings... 
 
[At Monk's. Jerry and Lanette.] 

JERRY
I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life. 

LANETTE
Now, what time are you picking me up tonight? 

JERRY
Eh, what? 

LANETTE
You got our reservation from Sfuzi's, didn't you? 

JERRY
Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that. 

LANETTE
Should I ware the outfit I bought today? 

JERRY
Sure. 

LANETTE
Which one? 

JERRY
The one with the...[mumbles.] 

LANETTE
If I wanna get my hair cut I've gotta go now. Call me when you get home. I wont be there, but leave a message so I know you called. 

JERRY
Ok, ok... 

LANETTE
Do you mind? 

JERRY
No, I'll crab it. 
[Lanette leaves and Jerry bangs his head to the table. George walks in.] 

GEORGE
Hey, I've done that today. 

JERRY
What, did you lose your remote? 

GEORGE
Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead. 

JERRY
It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something. 

GEORGE
[Laughs] Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up? 

JERRY
Not. 

GEORGE
No, no... 

JERRY
No, because that's... 

GEORGE
No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up? 

JERRY
Here. 

GEORGE
Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves. 

JERRY
I'm trying. 

GEORGE
I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man. 

JERRY
Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right! 
 
[Kramer at Sardi's, talking with two producers.] 

MR. GRAHAM
I'm sure how excited you are to have this very very prestigious award. But you didn't have anything to do with the actual production. 

KRAMER
No. 

MR. GRAHAM
I don't think there's no way how we can allow you to keep this Tony. Unless... 

KRAMER
Anything... 

MALCOLM
Are you familiar with our star, Raquel Welch? 

KRAMER
Oh yeah, she's fantastic.... 

MR. GRAHAM
She's a train wreck. 

MALCOLM
There's a big tap dance number just before Jean Harris leaves the (?) school to confront Dr Tarnover. 

MR. GRAHAM
It is a gut wrenching scene. 

MALCOLM
But, Raquel Welch doesn't move her arms when she tap dances. It's very distracting. 

MR. GRAHAM
There's lot of this [swings his arms] in tap dancing. 

KRAMER
So, you'd like me to teach how to dance? 

MALCOLM
No, we want you to fire her. 
 
[5A. Jerry and Kramer.] 

JERRY
Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch? 

KRAMER
Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping
lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true. 

JERRY
She seems very nice. 

KRAMER
Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like. 

JERRY
I'm in show business. 

KRAMER
Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive. 

JERRY
I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help. 

KRAMER
Yayaya... 
[Elaine enters.] 

ELAINE
Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me. 
[Takes a tape recorder and plays the tape.] 

SAM'S VOICE
Elaine...I am going to find you. If not in your office then in the xerox room or the little conference room near to the kitchen... 

ELAINE
She must've got a blueprint of the building or something. 

JERRY
Did you tell Peterman about this? 

ELAINE
Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight. 

KRAMER
Cat fight? 

ELAINE
Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight? 

KRAMER
Yeye cat fight! 

JERRY
Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss. 

KRAMER
T-t-t-t... 
 
[Jerry and George are walking down the street.] 

JERRY
You got the tickets? 

GEORGE
Yeah, two for the 7:15 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're wearing the green sweater? 

JERRY
I like it. 

GEORGE
She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. [Takes sweater out of his bag.] 

JERRY
What? 

GEORGE
Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you
go, hey, hey, hey, hey...[sprays Binaca into Jerry's mouth.] Go get'em you're a tiger! 

JERRY
Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations. 

GEORGE
A little notice would've helped! How many people? 

JERRY
35, and George, on the invitations... 

GEORGE
I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go... 
[Jerry leaves and Lanette joins him.] 

LANETTE
Right on time, I like that. 

JERRY
I like your nails, that is a great color. 

LANETTE
Love the sweater. 

JERRY
This old thing? 
 
[George is getting the invitations, Melody Stationers.] 

GEORGE
Hi, I need some party invitations. 

CLERK
Okay, have you been in here before? 

GEORGE
About a year ago. Wedding invitations. 

CLERK
Right, how did that all work out? 

GEORGE
No complaints. 

CLERK
Well, they are arranged according the price. And as I recall...[she flips the sample book all the way to the end.] 

GEORGE
Actually, [George flips the book back to the beginning] I'll take these nice glossy ones. 
 
[Majestic theater, Raquel Welch's dressing room.] 

RAQUEL
"You are a fraud Dr Tarnover. You haven't even been to Scarsdale." 
[Kramer knocks on the door and enters.] 

KRAMER
Ms. Welch. 

RAQUEL
Who are you? 

KRAMER
Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers. 
[Phone rings and Raquel answers.] 

RAQUEL
Hello, Sidney! No, no I told you I don't want to do that! If you bring it up again I will feed your genitals to a wolf! [hangs up] Kids! You're still here. 

KRAMER
Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance. 
[Raquel kicks a chair out of her way.] 

RAQUEL
What kind of problem? 

KRAMER
Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks... 

RAQUEL
Out with it! 

KRAMER
Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go... 
[Kramer runs out, but Raquel grabs him from the back.] 
-- 
[George walks at the park with the invitations. A frisbee flies to his feet.] 

GUY
Little help? 

GEORGE
Hey, frolf? 

GUY
Yeah, you know we need a fourth for the back nine. You want in? 

[GEORGE LOOKS UP AND SEES JERRY ON THE OTHER SIDE AND FRISBEE ON THE OTHER. JERRY SAYS
"What's the deal with airplane peanuts?"] 

GEORGE
Yeah, sure. 

GUY
Ok, come on. 
- 
[Jerry is at Lanette's apartment. They are both wearing a towel.] 

JERRY
Ok, let's towel it up. 

LANETTE
Jerry, where are those invitations you were supposed to get? If they don't go out today they're useless. 

JERRY
But we're in towels. 

LANETTE
Jerry. 

JERRY
all right. One second. 
[Picks up the phone.] 
[George runs up the stairs] 

GEORGE
He frolfs, he scores...[he drops one invitation on the stairs.] 
[George comes to his apartment and picks up the phone.] 

GEORGE
Hello. 

JERRY
George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman! 

LANETTE COMES BY
Did you shave your chest hair? 

JERRY
No. [Lanette leaves.] Did you at least pick them up? 

GEORGE
Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had. 

JERRY
Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George. 

GEORGE
All right, All right, keep your towel on. 

JERRY
..what? 

GEORGE
It's a joke. 

JERRY
All right, that's not bad. Now get over here! 
[George leaves from his apartment and comes down the stairs. He slips on an invitation and falls on his back.] 
 
[Elaine is on the street and plays a tape to two police officers.] 

SAM'S VOICE ON THE TAPE
..if not in your apartment then in the laundry room or the ATM in the building across the street or the watch shop! 

ELAINE
Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho! 

COP#1
'Reer.' 

ELAINE
Look, just because I'm a woman... 

COP#2
'Mauau.' 

COP#1
'Meeow.' 
 
[Raquel Welch walks down the street.] 

RAQUEL
I don't move my arms when I dance. That's my signature! 
 

ELAINE
Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks. 

COP#1
What do you mean? 

ELAINE
Like this...[imitates the walk with her arms hanging.] 
[Raquel Welch comes towards her.] 

RAQUEL
What the hell is that? Are you making fun of my dancing? 

ELAINE
Aren't you Raquel Welch? 

RAQUEL
You know who I am. Now, what are you doing? 

ELAINE
Nothing, I wasn't just moving my arms... 

RAQUEL
That's it, you are going down. 

COP#1
Ooh, cat fight. 
 
[The New York Hospital. Jerry and Kramer.] 

KRAMER
So how's George? 

JERRY
I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? [Kramer holds a broken Tony] 

KRAMER
Tony. 

JERRY
What happened to you? 

KRAMER
Raquel Welch! 

JERRY
Yikes. 
[Elaine comes. She has a scars on her face.] 

JERRY
What happened to you? 

ELAINE
Raquel Welch! 

KRAMER

Mr. Costanza. ..your legs have sustained extensive trauma. Apparently your body was in the state of advanced atrophy, due to a period of extreme inactivity.
But with a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, I think there's a good chance you may, one day, walk again.

JERRY
Yeah, what else?

GEORGE
All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?

JERRY
Happy, Pappy? What does that mean?

Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, "Happy, Pappy?"

JERRY
Oh, you're "Pappy".

GEORGE
I'm "Pappy".

JERRY
Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?

GEORGE
Oh, come on. What, are you kidding? George: I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind there backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she "shuushed you" while you were watching TV.

Hey, I got a real thing about "shushing"!

GEORGE
No, we're not. We're not men.

JERRY
We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.

GEORGE
I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do.

JERRY
Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?

GEORGE

JERRY
We're pathetic… you know that?

GEORGE
Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.

JERRY
Why can't I be normal?

GEORGE
Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal.

JERRY
It would be nice to care about someone.

JERRY
Hmm. I thought she became a lesbian.

GEORGE
No. It didn't take.

JERRY
Oh.

GEORGE
Did I tell you I ran into her last week? Ho-ho, she looked great.

JERRY
Hmm.

GEORGE
You thought she was good looking, right?

JERRY
See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?

GEORGE
I was just curious.

JERRY
Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me. George:, I am really gonna make some changes.

GEORGE
Yes. Changes.

JERRY

JERRY
I had a very interesting lunch with George: Costanza today.

KRAMER
Really?

JERRY
We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.

KRAMER
So, then you asked yourselves, "Isn't there something more to life?"

JERRY
Yes. We did.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't.

JERRY
There isn't?

KRAMER
Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, Jerry:? Marriage? Family?

JERRY
Well...

KRAMER
They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?

JERRY

KRAMER
Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.

JERRY
I can?

KRAMER
Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner?

JERRY
What?

KRAMER
You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?

Look, just meet with him. ?????.

Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time.

NEWMAN
What kind of dog did you say it was?

ELAINE
Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it.

NEWMAN
I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across.

NEWMAN
If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, USELESS BEASTS . . .

KRAMER
Newman: ! Stop it!!

NEWMAN
Anyway.

ELAINE
Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?

NEWMAN
Well, Elaine:, There's any number of things I could do. But, I can promise you this, though, this vicious beast will never bother you again. So, what's it going to be?

ELAINE
No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.

KRAMER
I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.

NEWMAN

Scene

AT THE RESTAURANT! GEORGE
is coming from the bathroom 
to sit with his bride-to-be.

GEORGE
I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?

SUSAN
Well, maybe it's so you can see if there's someone in there.

GEORGE
Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?

SUSAN
Well, as a backup system, in case the lock is broken, you can see if it's taken.

GEORGE
A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.

SUSAN
Can we change the subject, please?

GEORGE
Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?

SUSAN
No, fine. If you wanna keep talking about it, we'll talk about it.

GEORGE
It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.

SUSAN
Well, I didn't think that it had any momentum.

GEORGE
(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.

Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.

ELAINE
Well, what do you want me to do?

JERRY
Well, at least have some reaction to it.

ELAINE
…Well, I don't.

JERRY
Maybe you're a little jealous.

ELAINE
Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George:?

JERRY
No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.

ELAINE
Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.

JERRY
Oh, yeah. Right.

Yeah, right.

Lainy!

Hey.

KRAMER
Elaine:, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?

ELAINE
Oh, dear.

KRAMER
It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry:?

We're gonna change the system.

Yes!

GEORGE
No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.

JERRY
Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?

GEORGE
All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea: Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.

Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.

GEORGE
It's good, right?

I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.

GEORGE
You do?

JERRY
Yes, I do.

GEORGE
Well, I told it to Susan: before, and she didn't like it.

JERRY
Hmm.

GEORGE
Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, "Can we change the subject?"

JERRY
See, now that I don't care for.

GEORGE
Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?

JERRY
It should resolve of its own volition.

GEORGE
That's exactly what I said, except I used the word "momentum".

JERRY
Momentum - same thing.

GEORGE
Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?

JERRY
Yeah, I know.

GEORGE
Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.

JERRY
You're turning.

GEORGE
Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.

JERRY
If you need more time, you should have more time.

GEORGE
What, you think I could postpone it?

JERRY
Sure you can. Why not?

GEORGE
That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it?

JERRY
I don't see why not.

GEORGE
So, I could do that?

JERRY
Sure, go ahead.

GEORGE
All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.

JERRY
Spring. Of course.

GEORGE
Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.

JERRY
Beautiful.

GEORGE
She's not gonna like it.

JERRY
No, she's not.

GEORGE
You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.

JERRY
Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.

GEORGE
Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.

JERRY
Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
[Kramer enters]

KRAMER
Hey, hey.

GEORGE
March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?

JERRY
Oh, all the way.

GEORGE
You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.

JERRY
Is that so?

JERRY
Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?

KRAMER
Definitely.

JERRY
You're kidding?

KRAMER
No, no, I would turn you in.

JERRY
You would turn me in?

KRAMER
Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it.

JERRY
I can't believe your a friend of mine.

KRAMER
What kind of person are you going around killing people?

JERRY
Well, I am sure I had a good reason.

KRAMER
Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?

JERRY
But you know me!

KRAMER
I thought I DID!
[Rabbi's apartment]

ELAINE
I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.

RABBI
Would you care for a snack of some kind? I have the Snackwells which are very popular but I think that sometimes with the so called fat free cookies people may overindulge forgetting they may be high in calories

ELAINE
Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .

RABBI
How wonderful.

ELAINE
Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.

RABBI
Doesn't it give you any joy to see your friend enter into this holiest of unions?

ELAINE
No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.

RABBI
You know, Elaine, very often we cannot see the forest for the trees.

ELAINE
Yeah, I don't know what that means.

RABBI
Well, for example, say there's a forest, . . .

ELAINE
You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.

RABBI
You know my temple has many single functions.

ELAINE
No, no, it's okay.

RABBI
My nephew Alex is someone who is also looking perhaps …

ELAINE
I don't think so.

RABBI
He owns a flower store. Very successful.
[Outside Coffee shop]

JERRY
So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.

KRAMER
Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.

JERRY
Another Caf Latte?

KRAMER
You better believe it.

KRAMER
Since when are you so trendy?

JERRY
Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf Latte?

JERRY
I don't recall you drinking Caf Latte.

KRAMER
I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.

JERRY
Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.

KRAMER
I've always wanted to see this.

JERRY
You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.

KRAMER
Well, yeah, lets do it uh?

JERRY
Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.

JERRY
Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.

KRAMER
Maybe I will.
[George's]

GEORGE
Hi,

SUSAN
How was your day?

GEORGE
Good, good day. How was your day?

SUSAN
Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?

GEORGE
Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.

SUSAN
Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night.

GEORGE
The Lowers, really?

SUSAN
You don't want to go?

GEORGE
No, I want to go.

SUSAN
So what did Jerry have to say?

GEORGE
Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!

SUSAN
Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.

GEORGE
Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?

SUSAN
Yeah.

GEORGE
Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.

SUSAN
What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?

GEORGE
No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the …

SUSAN
If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. [crying] Say so.

GEORGE
Still marry , still marry.

SUSAN
You don't love me.

GEORGE
Sstill love. Still love.

SUSAN
My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making a mistake.

GEORGE
No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I …It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.

SUSAN
Are you sure?

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.
[Monk's]

JERRY
Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.

GEORGE
How did you know that?

JERRY
I live and breathe my friend. . . . I live and breathe.

GEORGE
I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.

JERRY
tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.

GEORGE
You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.

JERRY
Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.

GEORGE
I didn't have any sex.

JERRY
You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.

GEORGE
I didn't have make-up sex.

JERRY
In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.

GEORGE
Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!

WOMAN
[crying]

MAN
I can tell you're very upset but I'm sorry I'm not goin'

GEORGE
Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.

MAN
Are you going to eat thoise fries?

GEORGE
This is amazing. [George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand] Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better [to woman]

JERRY
. . . Poor bastard.
[Outside Elaine's]

JERRY
Good evening, Rabbi.

RABBI
Good evening. And how does this evening find you?

JERRY
Well, Rabbi, well.

RABBI
I trust you are here to see your friend, Elaine.

JERRY
Yeah, that's right.

RABBI
I hope she's feeling better.

JERRY
What do you mean?

RABBI
She didn't tell you?

JERRY
No.

RABBI
Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her feeling bitter and hostile.

JERRY
is that so?

RABBI
Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting married.

JERRY
Really?

RABBI
She came off as pretty desperate.

JERRY
I didn't know any of this.

RABBI
Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either. I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation.

JERRY
Hum, well it all comes as news to me.
[George's apartment]

G
[enters] Hi.

SUSAN
Hi, how was your day?

GEORGE
Good, good day. How was your day?

SUSAN
Ah, it was okay. What's going on?

GEORGE
Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?

SUSAN
Yeah, sure.

GEORGE
You see this is the thing. . . . [crying] I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, [cry]

SUSAN
George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is what you want.

GEORGE
Yeah?

SUSAN
Oh, don't worry your head. Of course.

GEORGE
All right. [smiles behind her back]
[Elaine's]

ELAINE
I've got that magazine article for you.

JERRY
You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.

ELAINE
Are you

JERRY
Understand you had a little talk with him too.

ELAINE
Yeah, talked earlier.

JERRY
Yes I know, I know.

ELAINE
 . . What does that mean?

JERRY
Nothing, nothing.

ELAINE
He didn't mention . . .

JERRY
Yes he did.

ELAINE
He told you about our conversation?

JERRY
We had quite a little chat.

ELAINE
He told you about . . .

JERRY
Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.

ELAINE
He told you all that? How could he?

JERRY
It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.

ELAINE
Can he do that?

JERRY
He did it.

ELAINE
But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?

JERRY
That's what's so fascinating.
[Movie line]

JERRY
You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let you in with it.

KRAMER
Why not?

JERRY
Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.

KRAMER
Well that's stupid

JERRY
That's the rule.

KRAMER
Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.
[Kramer puts coffee cup into his pants]
[Rabbi's apartment]

RABBI
Oh, Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again.

E
Yeah…

RABBI
Can I offere you some Kasha Varnishkas?

ELAINE
No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?

RABBI
Was that a problem for you?

ELAINE
Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?

RABBI
Well, let's see? I seem to recall a conversation with Mrs. Winston in 1F.

ELAINE
Mrs. Winston?

RABBI
Yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to mention to her how you felt that it was never going "to happen" for you.

ELAINE
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?

RABBI
Don Ramsey?

ELAINE
You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.

RABBI
Oh him! Well this morning I found myself in the elevator with him…

ELAINE
my god, you didn't.
[Movie theatre]

JERRY
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me

KRAMER
Oh, yow, oow Ah!

USHER
Hey, hey, what's going on? What just happened here?

KRAMER
Nothing Nothing.

USHER
Whatya got? One of those Caf Latte's in your shirt?

KRAMER
I don't have anything. Ask him.
[ Jerry makes a silent drink gesture]

USHER
All right, come on Coffee Boy, bring it out.

KRAMER
What?!

USHER
Here you go.

KRAMER
Ow
[Kramer leaves]
[Jerry's apartment]
Ex; But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.

JERRY
Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.

ELAINE
You didn't say this to George, did you?

JERRY
No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?

ELAINE
Yeah that! So, . . .
[George enters]

GEORGE
Hey oh.

ELAINE
GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.

GEORGE
Alright, thanks a lot.

ELAINE
Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.
[Gives George a kiss]

GEORGE
Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...

ELAINE
Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.

GEORGE
Well, I guess I'm getting older.

ELAINE
Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan:.
George Yeah.
Elaine My most, just heartfelt congratulations.

GEORGE
Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.

ELAINE
Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.

GEORGE
Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.

ELAINE
Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.

GEORGE
Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?

JERRY
Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh…

GEORGE
Nope. I wept like a baby.

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.

JERRY
You cried?

GEORGE
I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry:, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.
Jx,Gx & Kx Hey!

JERRY
Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.

KRAMER
Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.

JERRY
Suing? What for?

KRAMER
The coffee was too hot.

JERRY
It's supposed to be hot.

KRAMER
Not THAT hot.
Scene
[At George's home. He and Susan are in bed watching TV]

RABBI
[On TV] The prophet Isaah tells us without friends our lives are empty and meaningless.

GEORGE
Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi: from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.

RABBI
A young lady I know, let's call her Elaine:, happened to find herself overwhelmed with feelings of resentment and hostility for her friend, let's call him George:. She felt that George was somewhat of a loser and that she was the one who deserved to be married first. She also happened to mention to me that her friend had wondered if going to a prostitute while you're engaged is considered cheating. His feeling was they're never going to see each other again so what's the difference. But that is a subject for another sermon. Now, I'd like to close with a psalm.
End.

[SETTING
Booth at Monk's Cafe]

GEORGE
And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.

ELAINE
I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the
whole marriage thing.

GEORGE
Ya know, I was just a little surprised.

JERRY
Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?

GEORGE
What about all the loser stuff?

ELAINE
I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said
"I've never seen you looser".

JERRY
I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's
there, it's 2 aisles over.

GEORGE
(Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.

JERRY
Where you going?

GEORGE
I'm going shopping with Susan.

ELAINE
What kind of shopping?

GEORGE
Clothes shopping.

ELAINE
Where are you going?

GEORGE
Ross'.

ELAINE
Oh that's a nice store.

GEORGE
Yeah, it's her uncle's.

JERRY
Discount?

GEORGE
(As he leaves) One would hope.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Jackie Child's Office]
(Kramer is sitting across from Jackie)

KRAMER
So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off
and bought this cafe latte.

JACKIE
(Agreeing) Hm Hm. Oh what is that like Italian coffee?

KRAMER
Yeah that's right.

JACKIE
Half milk, half coffee?

KRAMER
Yeah.

JACKIE
Hm Hm. You take a sip?

KRAMER
Yes I did.

JACKIE
Now when you took a sip, did you notice it was hot? Were you able to sip
it in your normal fashion?

KRAMER
No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.

JACKIE
Hm Hm. All right, all right. You take big sips?

KRAMER
Well I think I take a normal sip.

JACKIE
O.K. You take normal sips. Nothing wrong with that. Then what happened?

KRAMER
Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater.
So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.

JACKIE
Yeah, see they like to sell their own coffee.

KRAMER
Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?

JACKIE
Yeah that's going to be a problem. It's gonna be a problem for them.
This a clear violation of your rights as a consumer. It's an infringement on your
constitutional rights. It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous.

KRAMER
It's definitely preposterous.

JACKIE
So. Then what happened?

KRAMER
Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and
I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.

JACKIE
Was there a top on it?

KRAMER
Yeah.

JACKIE
Now did you put the top on or did they put the top on for you?

KRAMER
No. They put the top on.

JACKIE
And they made the top. You didn't make the top did you?
(Kramer motions that he did not make the top)

JACKIE
(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. I want you to go down to Java World.
Get me a cafe latte with a top. (To Kramer) We're gonna run some test on that top.
Have you been to the doctor?

KRAMER
Ah No no, I haven't.

JACKIE
(To secretary over intercom) Suzie. Call Dr. Bison. Set up an appointment
for Mr. Kramer here. Tell him it's from me.

KRAMER
So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.

JACKIE
Jackie.

KRAMER
Jackie. I mean, we have a chance?

JACKIE
Do we have a chance? You get me one coffee drinker on that jury, you
gonna walk outta there a rich man.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Ross' clothing store]
(Susan is holding a bright red shirt up to George)

GEORGE
I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.

SUSAN
Well you could use a little flash.

GEORGE
All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot
of woman that would love to be in your position right now.

SUSAN
Name one.

MR ROSS
So, you find anything?

SUSAN
Oh, he's impossible to shop for uncle Ned.

MR ROSS
I'm going on vacation to Costa Rica. Maybe I'll see you in a couple of
weeks.

SUSAN
O.K.

SALESMAN
Excuse me Mr Ross.
(George notices the security guard standing near the front door)

GEORGE
See now this I don't get.

SUSAN
What?

GEORGE
The security guard.

SUSAN
What about him?

GEORGE
Why does he have to stand?

SUSAN
Because he's a security guard.

GEORGE
But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day?
That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.

SUSAN
George, you just met him. Don't say anything to him.

GEORGE
Aren't you concerned about the security guard?

SUSAN
Not really. (Walks away)

GEORGE
(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What
kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man
has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.

SUSAN
All right George. (She puts the red shirt up to him again) What do you
think?
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Elaine and Jerry are in Jerry's apartment.]

JERRY
So ah, what did you do last night?

ELAINE
Nothing.

JERRY
I know nothing, but what did you actually do?

ELAINE
Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.

JERRY
Wow. That really is nothing.

ELAINE
I told ya.
(Kramer enters)

KRAMER
Hey.

JERRY
Hey.

ELAINE
Hey.

JERRY
What are you all dressed up for?

KRAMER
Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.

JERRY
Oh yeah, how's that looking?

KRAMER
Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one
coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man.

ELAINE
That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote?
I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.

KRAMER
Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.

JERRY
Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.

KRAMER
Oh I can be quite litigious.

ELAINE
What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there
coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.

KRAMER
Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.

ELAINE
(Mocking) Jackie says the top was faulty.
(Sounds of knocking in the background on Kramer's door)

KRAMER
Hey Maestro!

MAESTRO
Ah, Kramer.

KRAMER
I'm in here. How's it going.

MAESTRO
Fine.

JERRY
Hi Bob.
(Kramer coughs purposely and motions toward maestro with his head)

JERRY
(Apologetically) Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro.

KRAMER
Well, this is a surprise ha?

MAESTRO
I just wanted to drop off this Chinese balm for your burns. It's supposed
to be great stuff. It's all herbal.

KRAMER
Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you
believe this Maestro?

MAESTRO
It's nothing.

KRAMER
Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.

MAESTRO
Oh yeah, I've been at my house in Tuscany.

KRAMER
Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.

JERRY
I hear it's ah beautiful there.

MAESTRO
Well if you're thinking of getting a place there don't bother. There's
really nothing available.

JERRY
(Surprised) Huh?
(Elaine enters from bathroom)

MAESTRO
(Seeing Elaine) Oh!

ELAINE
Hello.

MAESTRO
Well Hello. And who might you be?

ELAINE
I might be Elaine.

JERRY
This is a, Bob Cobb.

KRAMER
Maestro.

ELAINE
Oh, Maestro.

MAESTRO
It is my very great pleasure. (Kisses Elaine's hand)

ELAINE
Enchante.

MAESTRO AND ELAINE (SIMULTANEOUSLY)
Well I have to be going.

ELAINE
Jinx buy me a coke.

MAESTRO
Oh. Love it when that happeneds.

ELAINE
I know I know. That is so ahh ......

MAESTRO
Coincidental.

ELAINE
Yeah, thanks. O.K. Bye you guys.

MAESTRO
Ciao.
(Elaine and Maestro leave)

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.
(Kramer shuts the door and stares at Jerry)

KRAMER
You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.

JERRY
Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?

KRAMER
That's right.

JERRY
Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.

KRAMER
Why?

JERRY
Because it's a stupid thing to be called.

KRAMER
Jerry he's a conductor.

JERRY
Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.

KRAMER
Well, he's still a conductor.

JERRY
Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.

KRAMER
Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.
(Kramer makes like a conductor and makes a classic Kramer sound)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Monks Cafe. George and Jerry are sitting across from each other]

JERRY
New shirt?

GEORGE
Yeah. You like it.

JERRY
No, not particularly.

GEORGE
Why, the color?

JERRY
Yeah.

GEORGE
Too flashy?

JERRY
Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?

GEORGE
(Obviously lying) No.

JERRY
(Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.

GEORGE
Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you
that they make the security guard just stand there all day?

JERRY
No.

GEORGE
See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense
the slightest human suffering.

JERRY
Are you sensing anything right now?

GEORGE
Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in
one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?

JERRY
Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.

GEORGE
What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take?
Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up)
Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!

JERRY
Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.

GEORGE
Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be
very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk
with him.

JERRY
I know you will.
(Kramer enters and sits next to Jerry)

KRAMER
Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.

GEORGE
Who?

JERRY
His lawyer.

KRAMER
Yeah, Java World wants to settle.

JERRY
What?

KRAMER
Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.

JERRY
Why are they settling?

KRAMER
Cause their afraid of bad publicity.

JERRY
All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?

KRAMER
Yeah that's right.

GEORGE
(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING

ELAINE
Uh ha.

Are you ready to order?

ELAINE
Oh God. What are you getting Bob?
(Maestro looks at Elaine with an annoyed look on his face)

MAESTRO
Good question. (to waiter) We'll need a few minutes.
(Maestro puts his head in his hand. He is visibly upset)

MAESTRO
You know, I'm sorry but, I didn't mention it earlier but actually I
preferred to be called Maestro.

ELAINE
Excuse me?

MAESTRO
Well, ya know I am a conductor.

ELAINE
Yeah, so?

MAESTRO
Oh I suppose it's O.K. for Leonard Burnstein to be called Maestro because
he conducted the New York Philharmonic. So he gets to be called Maestro and I don't.

ELAINE
Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he
was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called
him Lenny.

MAESTRO
I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social
situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said
"Hello Maestro, how about a beer". O.K. So that's a fact.

ELAINE
Maestro huh? O.K. (laughing)

JERRY
What do you mean?

KRAMER
Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it
healed it.

JERRY
So?

KRAMER
So? My lawsuit. I'm finished.

GEORGE
(To guard) Tired?

GUARD
No.

GEORGE
How come uh, no chair?

GUARD
What?

GEORGE
I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.

GUARD
I don't need a chair.

GEORGE
No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well
proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?

GUARD
Nope.

GEORGE
Would you like a chair?

GUARD
I suppose if they gave me one I'd sit down.

GEORGE
Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?

GUARD
Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your asking.

GEORGE
That's exactly my point.

GUARD
Well who wouldn't?

GEORGE
Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find
you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of
pleasure. Call me crazy.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Back seat of a cab. Jackie and Kramer]

JACKIE
You put the balm on? Who told you to put the balm on? I didn't tell you
to put the balm on. Why'd you put the balm on? You haven't even been to see the
doctor. If your gonna put a balm on, let a doctor put a balm on.

KRAMER
I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?

JACKIE
Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm
anyway?

KRAMER
The Maestro.

JACKIE
The who? What are you talking about Maestro?

KRAMER
My friend he's a conductor.

JACKIE
Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?

KRAMER
Well my stomach was burning.

JACKIE
I tell you what this is. This is a public humiliation.

KRAMER
Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.

JACKIE
Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read
the instructions?

KRAMER
Well I ...

JACKIE
(interrupts) No one can tell what a balm's gonna do. They're unpredictable.

KRAMER
I'm sorry Jackie.

JACKIE

KRAMER
(Motions with his head) Yeah, get over.

ELAINE
Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was
writing 'The Requiem'.

JERRY
(Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.

ELAINE
Really?

JERRY
So what about the "Maestro" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.

ELAINE
Yeah, I called him Maestro.

JERRY
You didn't mind?

ELAINE
Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.

JERRY
O.K. from now on I want you to call me "Jerry the Great".

ELAINE
I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".

JERRY
Why not you call him Maestro.

ELAINE
He is a Maestro.

JERRY
Well, I'm great.

ELAINE
So you say.

JERRY
What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?

ELAINE
Yeah. (bragging) I'm invited.

JERRY
You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky
he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.

ELAINE
Why?

JERRY
I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.

ELAINE
Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.

JERRY
In all of Tuscany? I wonder.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Office of a Java World building]

MR STAR
I say we offer him $50,000 that's it, take it or leave it.

MR BURNS
How do we know how severe the burns are? Why don't we have him
examined by a doctor.

MS. JORDAN
Listen, the faster we dispose of this the better. This thing gets into
the paper it will kill us.

MR STAR
All right, we'll start at 50,000 and free coffee at all of our stores.
(Secretary beeps)

MR STAR

MR STAR
Gentleman come in. Now we don't want to take up much of your time. Let's
make this short and sweet. We're prepared to offer you all the free coffee you
want in any of our stores throughout North America and Europe, Plus..

KRAMER
(Interrupting) I'LL TAKE IT!!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Jackie and Kramer in the back of a cab]

JACKIE
I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to take it?

KRAMER
No.

JACKIE
I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't there.

KRAMER
Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.

JACKIE
Free coffee?

KRAMER
Yeah.

JACKIE
I don't want free coffee. It's not hard to get coffee. I can get my own
damn coffee. I wanted to hear what came after that "Plus".

KRAMER
Well I didn't hear any Plus.

JACKIE
20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything like this.
(Kramer spots a Java World)

KRAMER
Look, Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm
gonna get myself a free cafe latte.

ELAINE
Yeah.

JERRY
Hey you know we were just talking about you.

MAESTRO
Oh yeah?

JERRY
Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses
available in Tuscany?

MAESTRO
You didn't find one, did you?

JERRY
No. I'm not really looking.

MAESTRO
Nor should you.

JERRY
So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?

MAESTRO
The houses are passed down from generation to generation, it's very hard.

JERRY
I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?

MAESTRO
It's booked solid!

ELAINE
It's BOOKED Jerry!

JERRY
How'd you get yours?

MAESTRO
Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about to pop in some
Verdi.
(Elaine starts to sing in Italian. Maestro and Elaine drive away)

JERRY
Maybe I'll check out France.
(George walks towards Jerry)

JERRY
Hey George, do you believe this guy?

GEORGE
Who?

JERRY
Bob Cobb.

GEORGE
Bob Cobb?

JERRY
You know, the Maestro.

GEORGE
Oh I missed the Maestro?

JERRY
Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.

GEORGE
Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?

JERRY
No.

GEORGE
So what do you care?
(George walks away leaving Jerry standing there by himself)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Monk's cafe. George and Jerry are sitting at the booth]

JERRY
I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of
Tuscany.

GEORGE
Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you
know how big Tuscany is?

JERRY
I have no idea.

GEORGE
It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.

JERRY
Oh, no way it's that big.

GEORGE
It's a big region.

JERRY
Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?

GEORGE
I don't know why I bother even talking to you.

JERRY
Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.

GEORGE
All right.
(George and Jerry hold there arms up in a truce)

GEORGE
So I spoke to the security guard.

JERRY
Yeah and?

GEORGE
Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair,
he'd sit.

JERRY
So are you gonna get him a chair?

GEORGE
Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.

JERRY
Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a
back or without.

GEORGE
Oh I think I'd go for the back.

JERRY
Swivel?

GEORGE
I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What
do you think of those.

JERRY
I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a
kitchen chair that would have been perfect.

GEORGE
You mean one of those vinyl things?

JERRY
Yes.

GEORGE
Vinyl yeah, maybe.

JERRY
How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a
minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.
(Jerry leaves the booth headed for the phone in the back of the cafe)

GEORGE
Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.

GEORGE
What do you think about a rocking chair?
(Camera shifts to inside a Java World and Kramer is exiting at the door)

KRAMER
(Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes,
it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here.
If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm
gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.
(Kramer exits and runs into Jerry and George)

JERRY
Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?

KRAMER
Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm
entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.

JERRY
That's it?

KRAMER
That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem.
Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.

JERRY
You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.

KRAMER
Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.

JERRY
You're racing!

KRAMER
Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.

whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.

CLERK
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.

GEORGE
Innocent mistake.

GEORGE
Well, here you go. What do you think?

GUARD

GIGGIO
The keys, here are the keys. You give me the check. Two million
lira. Seventeen hundred Americana. Molto generoso.
(A man approaches Mr. Giggio and whispers in his ear.)

GIGGIO
(To the man) Si, Si.

ELAINE
You're right Maestro.

JERRY
You didn't have to push me.

Hello

JAMES
This is your wake up service. It's 7:15

ELAINE
Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.

JAMES
Hot date last night?

ELAINE
I wish.

JAMES
A woman with a sexy voice like yours its hard to believe your waking up alone.

ELAINE
Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.

JAMES
Call me James.

ELAINE
Oh, all right, James. He he he
[Monks]

GEORGE
Your wake up guy asked you out?

ELAINE
Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,

JERRY
I don't know. Blind date?

ELAINE
What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.

JERRY
Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.

ELAINE
At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.

JERRY
I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.

ELAINE
Ah, . . .

GEORGE
Now you're off on a topic.

JERRY
You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.

ELAINE
Uh hu.

JERRY
Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.

GEORGE
You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.

ELAINE
I think she'd figure it out.
[waitress places plates on the table]

ELAINE
What? What is this?

JERRY
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.

ELAINE
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?

JERRY

GEORGE
No, not that I know of. (winks)

WILHELM
Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a problem with Morgan you can tell me.

GEORGE
Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)

WILHELM
I understand.
[Jerry's apartment]

JERRY
I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.

ELAINE
I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.

JERRY
You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?

ELAINE
I think I can tell.

JERRY
Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?

ELAINE
Twenty-five percent.

JERRY
Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.

ELAINE
You're way off.

JERRY
Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.

ELAINE
So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?

JERRY
UNDATEABLE!

ELAINE
Then how are all these people getting together?

JERRY
Alcohol.

ELAINE
(to George who is winking) What is your problem?

GEORGE
No problem here.

ELAINE
You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.

GEORGE
I had no idea.

ELAINE
Right there. Right there. You just did it again.

GEORGE
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.

ELAINE
You're eye still hurts?

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.

JERRY
Pulp couldn't make it across the table.

GEORGE
Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?

JERRY
Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.

GEORGE
Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.

ELAINE
What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?

GEORGE
Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.
[Kramer enters]

KRAMER

It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.

KRAMER
Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.

GEORGE
Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)

KRAMER
No, of course not. (winks back)
[Sports Memorabilia Shop]

KRAMER
You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.

STEINBRENNER
I don't know. An envelope doesn't really cut it.

KRAMER
Why?

STEINBRENNER
What is this? A birthday card. Ha ha . . . signed by the ENTIRE Yankee organization! . . . This could be worth something.

JERRY
Well, no, I'm not one of those.

HOLLY
When we were little girls Grandma Memma would take us to a matinee and then dinner here.

JERRY
Grandma Memma?

HOLLY
Elaine must have mentioned Grandma Memma.

JERRY
No, I think I would have remembered Memma.

HOLLY
Oh well, that's typical. Elaine never liked Grandma Memma.

WAITER
Ready?

HOLLY
I'll have the porterhouse medium rare, baked potato with sour cream,

JERRY
What do you recommend besides the steak?

WAITER
The lamb chops are good.

JERRY
Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?

WAITER
It's a full bird. Stuffed with ham, topped with gorganzola.

JERRY
You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.

WAITER

Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?

MORGAN
I had to cancel it. For some reason my wife got it into her head that it was more than just a massage.

GEORGE
Really?

MORGAN
Yeah, we had this big fight at lunch it looks like tonight I will be sleeping on the couch.

GEORGE
Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.

MORGAN
I know. Somebody around here has been giving Wilhelm the impression that I have been slacking off.

GEORGE
Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.

MORGAN
Costanza, you may be my only friend around here. By the way, you got that birthday card?

GEORGE
Ah, not yet.

MORGAN
Just make sure Steinbrenner doesn't get it until I sign it.

GEORGE
Yes sir!
[Jerry's apartment]

ELAINE
I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.

JERRY
Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?

ELAINE
Huh huh.

JERRY
Did she mention anything about our lunch?

ELAINE
Uh, kind of.

JERRY
What do you mean, "kind of."?

ELAINE
I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.

JERRY
What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.

ELAINE
You got that right.

JERRY
But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?

ELAINE
Um uh.

JERRY
What is she making?

ELAINE
I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.

JERRY
Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.

GEORGE
Who told you to sell the card?

KRAMER
You did.

GEORGE
No I didn't!

KRAMER
No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks)

GEORGE
I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.

KRAMER
Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital .

BOBBY
Oh, no. I'd never part with this card for anything in the world.

KRAMER
Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.

BOBBY
Paul O'Neill.

KRAMER
All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, just for you.

BOBBY
Would he? Paul O'Neill would do that?

KRAMER
For you he would.

BOBBY
Would he hit two home runs?

KRAMER
Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.

BOBBY
I know. Get out of this bed one day and walk again.

KRAMER
Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.
[Holly's apartment]

ELAINE
What about this candelabra?

HOLLY
Yeah, that was grandma Memma's also. She bought it on her trip to Europe in 1936. Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton. I was afrais you only ate . . . salad.

JERRY
Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton.

HOLLY
That is so funny. Did you just make that up?

JERRY
I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)

HOLLY
That was in Grandma's study.

ELAINE
What did you do, ransack the place after she died?

JERRY
This is some FINE mutton.

ELAINE
I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?

JERRY
Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)

ELAINE
It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.
[On the street - dogs following Elaine]

ELAINE
Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.
[Holly's]

HOLLY
Where are the napkins?

JERRY
What?

HOLLY
Grandma Memma's napkins. There's two missing. Elaine took them didn't she?

JERRY
I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?

HOLLY
You heard her. She coveted them. I bet she took them just to spite me. She's probably having a good laugh about it right now.
[On the street dogs chasing Elaine]

ELAINE
Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a
[Jame's apartment]

JERRY
Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?

ELAINE
Did you do with the dogs?

JERRY
Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?

ELAINE
These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.

JERRY
Why were dogs chasing you?

ELAINE
They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.

JERRY
I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.

ELAINE
We'll have to sleep head to toe.

JERRY
Head to toe?

ELAINE
Head to toe.
[The next morning at Jame's]

ELAINE
Hey, wake up. It's 8:30 you were supposed to walk me up at 7:15.

JERRY
I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.

ELAINE
You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?

JERRY
I'll make them later. Uh.
[Mr. Morgan's - he's asleep on the couch]
[Yankee Stadium - George's office]

WILHELM
Have you seen Morgan?

GEORGE
He's not here?

WILHELM
No, He's late.

GEORGE
It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.

WILHELM
Now, George, you don't have to cover for him any more. He's going to be gone soon and I'm going to recommend you for his job.

GEORGE
. . . gone?
[Monk's]

JERRY
It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.

GEORGE
I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.

ELAINE
Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.

GEORGE
Napkins?

ELAINE
I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.

JERRY
Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.

ELAINE
They were?

JERRY
Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.

ELAINE
Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.

GEORGE
What exactly is mutton?

JERRY
I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?

ELAINE
Oh, I must have left it at Jame's

JERRY
You spent the night at James's? Did we?

ELAINE
Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.

JERRY
Reversed positions?

ELAINE
Yeah, you know, head to toe.

JERRY
So what your genitals are still lined up.

ELAINE
No, because I slept with my back to him.
[long pause - no comment from the guys]
[Yankee Stadium]

KRAMER
Mr. O'Neill?

O'NEILL
Yeah.

KRAMER
Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me.

O'NEILL
I can give you an autograph there, but my pen's kind of screwed up. You'd only like half a "P" or something.

KRAMER
No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.

O'NEILL
Sure, I could help you there.

KRAMER
Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.

O'NEILL
Say what?

KRAMER
You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers.

O'NEILL
You promised a kid in the hospital that I would hit two home runs?

KRAMER
Yeah, well, no good?

O'NEILL
Yeah. That's no good. It's terrible. You don't hit home runs like that. It's hard to hit home runs. And where the heck did you get two from?

KRAMER
Two is better than one.

O'NEILL
That, that's ridiculous. I'm not a home run hitter.

KRAMER
Well, Babe Ruth did it.

O'NEILL
He did not.

KRAMER
Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?

O'NEILL
I'm not calling him a liar but he was not stupid enough to promise two.

KRAMER
Well, maybe I did overextend myself.

O'NEILL
How the heck did you get in here anyway?
[James's]

JAMES
(on phone) Oh, hi Elaine. You know I lost all of my 6:30 clients because of you. . . . Yeah, well why did you have to stick your feet in my face? . . . Yes, I have the jacket. Hold on. . . . (to dogs) Fellas!
[Hospital]

TV
The Yankees take the field on a beautiful afternoon.

KRAMER
It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?

BOBBY
After Paul O'Neill hits his first home run.
[Jerry's]

HOLLY
(from buzzer) It's Holly.

JERRY
Yeah. Come on up.

TV
And the two and one pitch to O'Neill. A towering shot back to deep right field and it's gone.
[Hospital]

KRAMER
Yeah.

TV
A home run for Paul O'Neill. The Yanks lead one nothing.

KRAMER
OH YEAH! ALL RIGHT!

BOBBY
One more to go.
[Jerry's]
[Holly enters]

JERRY
Hey. What's all this?

HOLLY
I decided I was going to make you dinner.

JERRY
I thought we were going out.

HOLLY
Well, after you scarfed up my mutton I had the irresistible urge to make pork chops for you. I said hello to Franco for you.

JERRY
Franco?

HOLLY
Your butcher, down the street.

JERRY
I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.

HOLLY
A little.

JERRY
That is so Franco.
[Hospital]

TV
Bottom of the eighth, score tied at one apiece. Two and one to Paul O'Neill.

KRAMER
You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.

KRAMER
He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.

TV
"Klick! Long fly ball into deep left field over Bell's head . . . O'Neill's rounding second O'Neill going for third, O'Neill rounding . . .

KRAMER
Come on Come on!

TV
. . . third being waived in.

KRAMER
GO! GO!!

TV
. . . Martinez throws it over Alomar's head. O'Neill is safe at home. And the Yankees take the lead.

KRAMER
An In The Park Home Run!

BOBBY
Yeay!

KRAMER
All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card)

TV
That's being scored a triple for Paul O'Neill with a throwing error charged to Martinez.

BOBBY
Hey, …

KRAMER
Huh?

BOBBY
… that's not a home run. (grabs frame)

KRAMER
Yeah, maybe not technically, but …

BOBBY
You said he'd hit two home runs.

KRAMER
Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!

BOBBY
Well, you're not taking that card.

KRAMER
Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that …
[Jerry's]

HOLLY
So, is the chop the way you like it?

JERRY
I usually like mine with an angioplasty.
[stuffs meat in sofa]
[Elaine enters]

ELAINE
You know something really stinks to high h… Holly! What are you doing here?

JERRY
What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.

ELAINE
I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.

HOLLY
What about the napkins?

ELAINE
I didn't take your napkins.

HOLLY
Then who did?

ELAINE
Ask Jerry.

JERRY
We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
[George's office, Yankee Stadium]

WILHELM
I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?

MORGAN
No sir, George never gave it to me.

GEORGE
No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .
[Kramer enters]

KRAMER
Hi,

WILHELM
What's this?

KRAMER
Oh, it's a birthday card.

KRAMER
(to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.

WILHELM
George, this is beautiful. Why didn't you tell me you were going to have it mounted like this?

KRAMER
And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.

WILHELM
Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work.

MORGAN
Ha ha, uh, well you screwed me again, Costanza. How am I supposed to sign the card now when it's already under glass?
[Jerry's]
[James enters with his dogs]

ELAINE
Uh, this is,…

HOLLY
Excuse me. What are those dogs wearing?

JAMES
Oh, bandanas, aren't they cute?

HOLLY
You gave Memma's napkins to some dogs?!

JERRY
Hey, what happened to my jacket?

JAMES
Oh, the dogs did that but it wasn't their fault, somebody stuffed some strange meat in the pocket.

HOLLY
Was it mutton?

JAMES
Could have been.

HOLLY
Do you always stuff meat in your pocket?
[Dogs climbing on sofa]

JERRY
Uh, sometimes I use the sofa.
[Steinbrenner's office]
[George enters]

GEORGE
You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?

STEINBRENNER
Yes, George, please, come in, come in.

STEINBRENNER
Thanks for the card. I loved it. Gosh it made me feel good. You know, word has it that you were the brains behind the whole thing.

GEORGE
Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.

STEINBRENNER
Morgan, Morgan, you know his name is conspicuously absent from this card. Almost like he went out of his way not to sign it.

GEORGE
Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.

STEINBRENNER
You can stop kowtowing to Morgan. Congratulations, you got his job.

GEORGE
Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.

STEINBRENNER
Stop it George, he's out, you're in.

STEINBRENNER
A lot more work you know.

GEORGE
I know.

STEINBRENNER
A lot more responsibility. Long long hours.

GEORGE
I know.

STEINBRENNER
Not much more money. But you'll finally get the recognition you deserve.

GEORGE
That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .

STEINBRENNER
You know as painfull as it is I had to let a few people go over the years. Yogi Berra, Lou Pinella, Bucky Dent, Billy Martin, Dallas Green, Dick Houser, Bill Virdon, Billy Martin, Scott Marrow, Billy Martin, Bob Lemmon, Billy Martin, Gene Michael, Buck Showalter, … uh, tut!, . . .George, you didn't hear that from me. [George exits] . . . George!
End.
(Jerry's stand-up)
I always feel bad for the silver medal winner in the Olympics.

HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH THAT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE? PEOPLE ARE GONNA KEEP ASKING
- How much did you lose by?
- I don't even know...! It was like...(very fast) now.now...now.now..now..was like, like...
now..now..now...!
It was it...! Eh, it was it and I lost. I trained, I worked out, I exercised, I did everything,
I was doing push-ups, sit-ups, I never did anything but exercise and work out for 20 years, I
flew half way around the world and aaaaaaaaaah!...(showing a tiny distance between his index
and thumb) And that was...it was a photo-finish! Silver...(stretching his neck forward)...gold.
If I had a pimple, I would've won.
(Monk's Restaurant - Jerry, George, Elaine)

JERRY
(to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog.

(TO GEORGE) GET THIS ONE
"I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a
welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest".

GEORGE
This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.

ELAINE
Yeah. What do you do all day?

GEORGE
Not that much.

ELAINE
uh-uh.

JERRY
I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.

GEORGE
Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.

JERRY
How do you pull that off?

GEORGE
I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're
busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds).

ELAINE
Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!

JERRY
Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!

GEORGE
I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls.
All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves)

ELAINE
(laughs)

JERRY
So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?

ELAINE
No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't!
I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.

JERRY
What marathon runner?

ELAINE
You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant,
editing a book on running...

JERRY
Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago
and missed the marathon?!

ELAINE
Yeah, that's him.

JERRY
He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?

ELAINE
Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. (laughs)

JERRY
How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?

ELAINE
Ah, I know. I know...!

JERRY
I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm
clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...

ELAINE
Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.

JERRY
Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands.

ELAINE
What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.

JERRY
You gotta wake him up!

ELAINE
Eh...he'll get up...
(A woman passes by with a baby)

ELAINE
Hi, Judy.

JUDY
Hi, Elaine. How are you?

ELAINE
Fine. (laughs)
(woman leaves)

JERRY
I've seen her in your building.

ELAINE
Yeah.

JERRY
I didn't know she was married.

ELAINE
(whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face)
Don't say anything to anybody.

JERRY
Whom I gonna tell?

ELAINE
I know, it's just something you have to say...
(George's office at the Yankee Stadium)
(George is reading a newspaper when he hears a fly that lands on his desk. He tries to kill it
with the paper but misses. Mr. Wilhelm comes in. George switches to annoyed-mode)

WILHELM
George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went over budget on some of the items,
but I don't think there's gonna be a problem. (hands over the budget file to a very
annoyed George) I'll let you get back to work, George. (Mr. Wilhelm leaves the office)
(George hears the fly again. It lands on the wall and he starts bashing it with the file.
Mr. Wilhelm sees George hitting the wall with the budget file and shakes his head, worried)
(Jerry's apartment - Jerry, George)

JERRY
He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?

GEORGE
I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.

JERRY
My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back
on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink)
Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.

KRAMER
Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.

JERRY
What do you do?

KRAMER
I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and...
(makes sound with the lips - "pop!") ...I get up!

JERRY
Always works?

KRAMER
It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal
mechanism. It knows what time it is.

GEORGE
uh-uh. What's with the bucket?

KRAMER
Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.

JERRY
Hot tub?

KRAMER
Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket)

GEORGE
You put a hot tub... in your living room?

KRAMER
Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating,
soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy)

GEORGE
Is that tolerable?

KRAMER
Oh...it's tolerable...! (happy)

JERRY
Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?

KRAMER
Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves)

GEORGE
He uh...doesn't have any running water?

JERRY
I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
(Monk's Restaurant - Jerry)
(Elaine and Jean-Paul come in)

ELAINE
Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.

JERRY
Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you.

JEAN-PAUL
Nice to meet you.

JERRY
Sorry about the Olympics.

JEAN-PAUL
Me too. (disappointed)

ELAINE
Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended.
I can't...come up with anything for this thing.

JERRY
Ah...catalog writer's block?

ELAINE
Yeah, that's funny. (annoyed)
(Elaine leaves)

JERRY
(pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?

JEAN-PAUL
Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was the snooze, but no, no snooze.

JERRY
AM/PM.

JEAN-PAUL
Man, it wasn't the AM/PM. It was the volume.

JERRY
Ah...the volume.

JEAN-PAUL
Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio alarm.

JERRY
Ah, separate knob.

JEAN-PAUL
Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate knob?! (frustrated)

JERRY
Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.

JEAN-PAUL
Oh, please, man, please!

JERRY
Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
(Elaine returns)

JERRY
Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?

ELAINE
Jerry...

JERRY
It's a simple question...

ELAINE
I've got an alarm, ok?

JERRY
That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?

JEAN-PAUL
Flight to Cleveland?

ELAINE
It works.

JERRY
Elaine...

ELAINE
It... works!
(George's office at the Yankee Stadium)
(George is doing the newspaper's crossword. The pen stops working.)

GEORGE
Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in)
(George switches to annoyed-mode again)

WILHELM
George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.

GEORGE
Well...I've got a lot to do!

WILHELM
George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd like you to drop everything.
(George acts annoyed)

WILHELM
I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. There's some reps in from
the Houston Astros for talks on that interleague play... and I want you to show them a
good time.(George acts like "ok, you're the boss")
(Jerry's apartment - Jerry)
(Elaine comes in)

ELAINE
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

JERRY
You're 40 minutes late. What happened?

ELAINE
I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?

JERRY
Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.

ELAINE
uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?

JERRY
Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race,
he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!

ELAINE
Oh are you?!

JERRY
Yes I am.

ELAINE
Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!

JERRY
Yeah, I know that!

ELAINE
Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that
Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but
I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!

JERRY
I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking
him up!

ELAINE
Hey, Jean-Paul.

JERRY
Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?

JEAN-PAUL
Ah, man, very good soak. The soak o'the year!

KRAMER
(smelling) What's burning?

ELAINE
Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)

JERRY
What happened?

ELAINE
Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.

KRAMER
This was set for 2 minutes. See?
(Jerry raises his hands in the air, worried)

ELAINE
(pointing at Jerry) Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!

JEAN-PAUL
You miss-set the timer...

ELAINE
(leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right,
listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.

JEAN-PAUL
Ok.

ELAINE
(to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?

JERRY
Yeah. I hope so ?!

ELAINE
Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)

JERRY
Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over
this whole operation!

KRAMER
Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.

JERRY
I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.

KRAMER
Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the
tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!
(Kramer's hot tub)
(The water is at 105.F degrees. Kramer takes his robe off and goes inside)

KRAMER
(relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really enjoying this)
(in a bar - George and 3 other men, drinking)

CLAYTON
...'till this bastard over here says: "let's call the sons o'bitches and go visit 'em on
New York!" (the 3 men laugh)

GEORGE
(smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.

GARDNER
I like your organization, George. We've been talkin' to a really friendly son of a bitch
in the front office. Wilhelm, I think his name.

GEORGE
Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah...

GARDNER
He told us that George Costanza was gonna be takin' us bastards out on the town.

(THE 3 MEN LAUGH AGAIN) I SAID
"that son of a bitch doesn't know what he's got in store
for him!". (the 3 men laugh once more)

ZEKE
Finish your drink?

GEORGE
Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost.

ZEKE
Let's get that bastard bring us another round! (waves to bartender)

CLAYTON
You a big drinker, George?

GEORGE
Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at Zeke, they all laugh) I can
hold my own! (they all continue laughing and drinking)
(Kramer's hot tub)
(The water is now at 53 degrees. Kramer is asleep inside and he's all trembling. He wakes up,
frozen, making trembling sounds, reaches for his robe and puts it on while in the tub.)
(Monk's Restaurant - Jerry, Jean-Paul)

JERRY
Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that
tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you
have chosen to stay... is uh...

JEAN-PAUL
What are you saying?

JERRY
I'm saying "get the hell outta there"! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable,
you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call,
Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!

JEAN-PAUL
Wake-up call...

JERRY
These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin'
to make that call! (George comes in)

JEAN-PAUL
No, I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude.

GEORGE
Hey, you bastards.

JERRY
Hey, how was the meeting?

GEORGE
I really like those sons of bitches.

JERRY
Sons of bitches?

GEORGE
Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch.
Yeah, it's like uh..."boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!" (laughs)

JEAN-PAUL
Really?!

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)
(Kramer walks in wearing winter coat, scarf, cap, gloves... They all look at him very surprised)

KRAMER
Heeeeey...

JERRY
How many sweaters you got on?

KRAMER
Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.

GEORGE
What's goin'on?

KRAMER
I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees.
I can't get my core temperature back up!

JERRY
Your core temperature?

KRAMER
(to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel.

JEAN-PAUL
Phew... this son of a bitch is ice-cold. (smiles)
(inside an airplane - the 3 men)
(They are calling George at the Yankee Stadium, while they're drinking and laughing in the plane)

GEORGE
Hello?

CLAYTON
uh...is that you, George?

GEORGE
(laughs) Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?

CLAYTON
Well listen, you son of a bitch! You know where we are? 30 000 feet above your head, you
bastard! (the 3 laugh and howl)

GEORGE
What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against
FAA regulation?

CLAYTON
(to the other 2 men) Hey, hush up, now! I can't hear him!

GEORGE
Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys
can't wait to kick your butts!

ZEKE
(to Clayton) When's that bastard comin' to Houston?

CLAYTON
Hey, Zeke wants to know when you Yankee bastards are comin' to Houston!

GEORGE
You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you
bastards are running things.

CLAYTON
Hey, uh, speak up, George, I can't hear ya!

GEORGE
(Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is
ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
(Mr.Wilhelm comes running, takes the phone from George and hangs up)

WILHELM
George! George, get a hold of yourself!

GEORGE
Mr.Wilhelm...

WILHELM
What's the matter with you?!

GEORGE
Well I-I...
(Elaine's office - Elaine)
(She's trying to think of a story for the shoes while she's at the computer)

ELAINE
(thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu...
(hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing
it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits)
(Elaine's building - Jean-Paul, Judy with baby)

JEAN-PAUL
Hello.

JUDY
Hello.

JEAN-PAUL
I'm a friend of Elaine's.

JUDY
Oh, hi.

JEAN-PAUL
(looks at the baby) oooooh...look at the cute little bastard... (the building manager
comes in) you are mama's little bastard, aren't you? (laughs)
(Judy goes away angry and Jean-Paul is surprised by that)

MANAGER
Whatta hell are you doin' harassing my tenants?

JEAN-PAUL
(smiling) Oh come on, you son of a bitch. I'm just trying to be friendly.

MANAGER
All right, that's it! (grabs Jean-Paul and gets him out) Let's go!

JEAN-PAUL
What...but I got a race tomorrow!
(Jerry's apartment at night- Kramer)
(Kramer is lying on Jerry's sofa, "fully" dressed and covered with a blanket. Jerry and George
come in)

GEORGE
Whoa...it's like a furnace in here!

JERRY
Oh whatta hell is goin'on?!

KRAMER
Yeah, I turned up the heat.

JERRY
Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)

KRAMER
I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.

GEORGE
Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?

KRAMER
Uh? Oh that must be it.

GEORGE
It's huge!

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's.
(Kramer leaves. The phone rings and Jerry picks it up)

JERRY
Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up)

GEORGE
(Jerry is going to his bedroom) What?

JERRY
I got the call...!

GEORGE
Jean-Paul?

JERRY
(stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)
(hotel - Jerry, Jean-Paul. Sitting in different beds)

JERRY
Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul.

JEAN-PAUL
Man, I just want to get some sleep. (gets into bed)

JERRY
All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 6:50...
volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to?
Top 40, classical...

JEAN-PAUL
Man, whatever! (annoyed)

JERRY
How about adult contemporary?

JEAN-PAUL
Fine, adult contemporary. Just pick one! (irritated)

JERRY
All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now...
the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials)

JEAN-PAUL
Yes, yes, the wake-up guy.

MAN
(on the phone) Front desk...?

JERRY
Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 6:50 AM tomorrow morning.

MAN
Yes sir.

JERRY
That's room 419. 6:50 AM. Four...one...niner...

MAN
Yes, I got it sir. You only had to say it once.

JERRY
I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.

MAN
Every wake-up call I make is important. You're no more important than any of our guests.

JERRY
Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...

MAN
Are you through? (annoyed)

JERRY
...Yeah I am, but I just...(man hangs-up)
(Jerry pauses thinking)

JERRY
humm...

JEAN-PAUL
What is it...?

JERRY
I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)

JEAN-PAUL
No, no.

JERRY
(gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!

JEAN-PAUL
Man, he doesn't got "in" for you.

JERRY
What if he doesn't call now out of spite?

JEAN-PAUL
It is his job!
(Jerry sits down)

JERRY
(pause) Not comfortable... (gets up again)

JEAN-PAUL
For God's sake...! (gets up and they start packing)
(Elaine's apartment)
(Elaine comes in)

ELAINE
Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?!
Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine.

JERRY'S MACHINE
I'm not here, leave a message.

ELAINE
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)
(She leaves her apartment and knocks on Judy's door)

ELAINE
Judy, hi, listen...

JUDY
You have got some nerve, Elaine! I told you about that baby in confidence!

ELAINE
Oh I didn't tell anyone.

JUDY
Well your friend certainly seemed to know all about it. (shuts the door)

ELAINE
... Jerry! (runs angry to her apartment)
(Jerry's apartment)
(Jerry and Jean-Paul come in)

JERRY
Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.

JEAN-PAUL
It's a marathon, you know. 26 miles! I need to get some sleep! (lies on the sofa)

JERRY
Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal
right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket)

JEAN-PAUL
Left a comfortable hotel bedroom for this!

JERRY
That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)
(Kramer checks the water temperature and then opens the door)

JERRY
(shouting) Man that thing is noisy!

KRAMER
(shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!

JERRY
Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 6:30 and gimme a call.

KRAMER
Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the "pop!" sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)
(street at night- Elaine walking and thinking, very worried)
(the following voices are on Elaine's mind)

JERRY
He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.

JEAN-PAUL
I trust Elaine, she is my friend. I trust Elaine, she is my friend.

JERRY
Frankly, I'm a little concerned.

ELAINE
Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so
strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard
child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet)
...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I
took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in
the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes!
(Jerry's apartment)

(TWO CLOCKS AT A TABLE, BOTH 4
2 AM. Jean-Paul's sleeping at the sofa)
(Kramer's apartment)

(4
2 AM. Kramer snores. The heat pump short circuits and blows the fuses on the entire building)
(Jerry's apartment)

(JERRY WAKES UP WITH THE SUNLIGHT. LOOKS AT THE ELECTRIC CLOCK, WHICH STOPPED AT 4
2)

JERRY
4:02? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!
(gets out of bedroom, in panic) Jean-Paul! The electricity went out! Wake up! Wake up!

WE GOTTA GO! IT'S 8
7!

JEAN-PAUL
8:47!? (jumps out of the sofa)
(both running around, getting ready to go)

JERRY
Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!

JEAN-PAUL
Idiot! I trusted you!
(Kramer comes in wrapped up in a blanket)

JERRY
Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!

KRAMER
Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!

JERRY
What happened to your mental alarm?!

KRAMER
I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down)
(New York marathon)
(Jerry and Jean-Paul try to get to the starting line through a crowd)

JERRY
Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way!
Make way, it's a contender! (an event guard stops them)

GUARD
Hey, hold it!

JEAN-PAUL
I'm late, man, I'm in the race!

GUARD
Go ahead.

JEAN-PAUL
Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver. Fantastic route, man!

JERRY
All right, go, it's a race! Come on!
(George Steinbrenner's office at the Yankee Stadium)
(George comes in)

GEORGE
You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?

STEINBRENNER
Yes, George, come in, come in. George, word up's you've been cracking under the
pressure. Can't cope, can't stand the heat. Spit the bit.

GEORGE
Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain...

STEINBRENNER
Oh we all get a little cuckoo sometimes George, I used to be like you. Rating
personnel 'till they cried, calling managers on the field during a game, threatening
to move the team to New Jersey, just to upset people. Then I found a way to relax.

I'VE GOT TWO WORDS TO SAY TO YOU, GEORGE
hot tub. (George looks at him, puzzled)
(New York marathon - Jerry, Elaine, Kramer)
(They're waiting for the runners to run by. Kramer remains "fully" dressed and is carrying a
thermos with tea).

JERRY
I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!

ELAINE
Then how did she find out, Jerry?!

JERRY
Maybe you should check with the rabbi.

KRAMER
(to Elaine) You want some hot tea?

ELAINE
Oh no, thank you.

KRAMER
Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!
(The first runner to appear is Jean-Paul)

ELAINE
There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)

KRAMER
Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on! (starts howling)

JERRY
Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!

ELAINE
Go Jean-Paaaaaul!
(We switch over to Jean-Paul. We hear him breathing. We hear his heart beating. Some people offer
him drinks. Jean-Paul grabs one, Kramer's hot tea, and leaves scene. Kramer gets very surprised.
We then hear Jean-Paul screaming in pain, and it's not hard to guess why. Kramer puts on a
"whatta hell" look, Elaine puts on an "ouch" look and Jerry puts on his "it's a shame" one.)
(Final credits - George and Mr.Steinbrenner inside a hot tub)

STEINBRENNER
How're you enjoying it, George? Melts that tension away, doesn't it? You gotta get
that jet on the good spot. Oh. Oh. Uh. Uh. Yes, that feels good. Yes, that's real
good. Oh yeah, that's where I keep all my tension. Right down to that chicken bone.
Sometimes I get my wife to just stuck her thumb right in there like a screwdriver.
Ya know, the Phillips head, not the flat one. Oh God, those flat ones frustrate me.
You got it in, but it slips out. You put it in again, slips out again. You a single
man, George?

GEORGE
(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...

STEINBRENNER
I'll tell you, if you wanna get something wild goin'on in your life, you get a girl
and bring her to one o'these things. Just like 4 shots a wild turkey. (laughs)
She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy. (George starts sliding, until he gets
all his head -and glasses- under water, as Steinbrenner keeps talking) A show,
about that Mickey Mantle, wasn't it? You know we used to talk. I don't think he
liked me very much, you know.
End.

GEORGE
All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st
and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.

JERRY
Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?

SHEILA
You called me shmoppy. You're a shmoopy.

JERRY
You're a shmoopy!

SHEILA
You're a shmoopy!

JERRY
You're a shmoopy!

GEORGE
All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.

JERRY
Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to
the soup place?

SHEILA
No. You have a good lunch. But I'll meet you back here for the
movie.

GEORGE
Hey.

ELAINE
Hey.

SHEILA
Hi Elaine.

ELAINE
Hi Sheila.

JERRY
All right, then. I'll see you later.

SHEILA
Bye shmoopy.

JERRY
Bye shmoopy.

ELAINE
Okay. We ready to go?

GEORGE
Yes. Please. Please, let's go.

ELAINE
Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.

JERRY
No. We gotta go to the soup place.

ELAINE
What soup place?

GEORGE
Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.

JERRY
He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other
day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.

ELAINE
Stunned by soup?

JERRY
You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.

ELAINE
Huh. All right. Come on.

JERRY
There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little
temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly
referred to as the Soup Nazi.

ELAINE
Why? What happens if you don't order right?

JERRY
He yells and you don't get your soup.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.

GEORGE
All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.

JERRY
All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
The main thing is to keep the line moving.

GEORGE
All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud,
clear voice, step to the left and receive.

JERRY
Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No
extraneous comments. No
questions. No compliments.

ELAINE
Oh, boy, I'm really scared!

JERRY
Elaine.

ELAINE
All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow!
Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow!
It's French. Armoire.

JERRY
Ar-moire.

ELAINE
How much is this?

FURNITURE GUY
I was asking 250, but you got a nice face. 2 even.

ELAINE
Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.

JERRY
He gave you the nice face discount.

ELAINE
Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.

JERRY
What about the soup?

ELAINE
I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.

JERRY
[in French accent] Pardon.

GEORGE
This line is huge.

JERRY
It's like this all the time.

GEORGE
Isn't that that Bania guy?

JERRY
Oh, no. It is. Just be still.

GEORGE
Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.

BANIA
Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup.

JERRY
Hard to believe.

BANIA
This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. You know
what they call him? Soup Nazi.

JERRY
Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.

BANIA
Why not?

JERRY
Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.

BANIA
Okay. Okay.

GEORGE
Medium turkey chili.

JERRY
Medium crab bisque.

GEORGE
I didn't get any bread.

JERRY
Just forget it. Let it go.

GEORGE
Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.

SOUP NAZI
Bread -- $2 extra.

GEORGE
$2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.

SOUP NAZI
You want bread?

GEORGE
Yes, please.

SOUP NAZI
$3!

GEORGE
What?

SOUP NAZI
No soup for you! [snaps fingers]
[cahsier takes George's soup and gives him back his money]

ELAINE
What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.

SUPER
Its Sunday, Elaine. There's no moving on Sunday. That's the rule.

ELAINE
But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception?
Please. I've got a nice face.

SUPER
Tomorrow, okay? You can move it in tommorrow. I'll even give you a
hand, all right?

ELAINE
Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.

FURNITURE GUY
I'm a guy on the sidewalk. I don't have layaway.

ELAINE
Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.

JERRY
Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?

GEORGE
You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not
even offer me any?

JERRY
I gave you a taste. What do you want?

GEORGE
Why can't we share?

JERRY
I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly
flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!

GEORGE
Do you hear yourself?

JERRY
I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.

GEORGE
Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.

SHEILA
Hi. Hi shmoopy.

JERRY
Hi shmoopy.

SHEILA
No, you're a shmoopy!

JERRY
You're a shmoopy!

GEORGE
I'm going.

JERRY
Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?

GEORGE
You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.

JERRY
Why?

GEORGE
I just don't feel like it anymore.

JERRY
Just like that?

GEORGE
Just like that.

SHEILA
Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he?

KRAMER
Hey.

JERRY
Hey.

KRAMER
[taking Jerry's couch cushion] Yeah.

JERRY
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?

KRAMER
Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all
night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.

JERRY
Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.

KRAMER
Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.

ELAINE
Do you need anything?

KRAMER
Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.

ELAINE
Mulligatawny?

KRAMER
Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of
the great soup artisans
in the modern era.

ELAINE
Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?

KRAMER
He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most
geniuses are.

ELAINE
All right. I'll be back.

KRAMER
Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.

ELAINE
Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.

KRAMER
No. No, Elaine!

ELAINE
Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?

GEORGE
No. I didn't get it.

ELAINE
Why? What happened?

GEORGE
I made a mistake.

ELAINE
[laughing]

GEORGE
All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.

ELAINE
Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of
there with a bowl of soup.

GEORGE
Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you
find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?

ELAINE
Oh, I know! It is awful!

GEORGE
Why do they have to do that in front of people?

ELAINE
I don't know.

GEORGE
What is that with the shmoopy?

ELAINE
Ohh!

GEORGE
The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!

ELAINE
Ohh! Stop it! I know.

GEORGE
I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is
actually called shmoopy.

ELAINE
Ugh!

GEORGE
And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.

ELAINE
You know, we should say something.

GEORGE
You know, we absolutely should.

ELAINE
I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff
that is?

GEORGE
I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.

ELAINE
Yeah.

GEORGE
I still haven't figured him out.

ELAINE
No. Me neither.

GEORGE
All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.

ELAINE
Oh, God!

GEORGE
Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.

SOUP NAZI
You're pushing your luck little man.

GEORGE
Sorry. Thank you.

ELAINE
Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One
mulligatawny and, um....
what is that right there? Is that lima bean?

SOUP NAZI
Yes.

ELAINE
Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever
told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, " Scent Of A Woman."
Who-ah! Who-ah!

SOUP NAZI
Very good. Very good.

ELAINE
Well, I --

SOUP NAZI
You know something?

ELAINE
Hmmm?

SOUP NAZI
No soup for you!

ELAINE
What?

SOUP NAZI
Come back one year! Next!

RAY
Look at this.

BOB
It's an antique.

RAY
It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.

BOB
Yes. Yes. me, too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it up. No. No.
Pick it up from the bottom over there.

KRAMER
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?

BOB
What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.

KRAMER
You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.

BOB
Look, you wanna get hurt?

KRAMER
Huh?

BOB
I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get hurt I can
hurt you. Now, just back off.

RAY
Bob.

BOB
Just pick it up.

KRAMER
What is this, huh?

BOB
You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding?
We taking the armoire and that's all there is to it. Okay?

ELAINE
I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna
call the states' attorney office. I really am.

GEORGE
Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.

ELAINE
All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit
down. What happened? Where's my armoire?

KRAMER
Well, b -- it was stolen.

ELAINE
Wha--?

KRAMER
These street toughs, they robbed me.

ELAINE
Street toughs took my armoire?

KRAMER
Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've
seen the way they talked to me.

ELAINE
I can't believe this!

KRAMER
Well, where's the soup?

ELAINE
Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.

KRAMER
Oh...yeah!

JERRY
What are you gonna get?

SHEILA
I'll decide at the last minute.

JERRY
You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
[Soup Nazi pounding on countertop]

JERRY
Uh-oh.

SOUP NAZI
Hey, what is this? You're kissing in my line? Nobody kisses in
my line!

SHEILA
I can kiss anywhere I want to.

SOUP NAZI
You just cost yourself a soup!

SHEILA
How dare you? Come on, Jerry, we're leaving. Jerry?

JERRY
Do I know you?

ELAINE
So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?

JERRY
It was a bisque.

ELAINE
Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become
much more normal than you.

JERRY
Really?

ELAINE
Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married.
Your top priority is soup.

JERRY
Have you tastes the soup?

ELAINE
Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.

JERRY
See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with
Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.

JERRY
Hey.

KRAMER
Yeah.

ELAINE
Hey.

KRAMER
Yeah.

JERRY
Oh, thanks.

ELAINE
There he is.

KRAMER
Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.

ELAINE
Yeah. I know. Me, too.

JERRY
So, did these thieves want any money?

KRAMER
No.

JERRY
They just wanted the armoire?

KRAMER
Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.
[interom buzzes]

JERRY
Yeah?

GEORGE
Hup! Hup!

JERRY
Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?

ELAINE
No. In what way?

JERRY
I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or
something.

ELAINE
I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.

GEORGE
Hello.

JERRY
Hello.

KRAMER
Hey.

GEORGE
Hello.

ELAINE
Hello.

GEORGE
Were you just talking about me? What's going on?

JERRY
Absolutely not.

GEORGE
Something's going on here.

KRAMER
All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.

ELAINE
One of these days that guy is gonna get his.

GEORGE
So, how was the movie?

JERRY
Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.

GEORGE
Oh, yeah?

JERRY
Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?

GEORGE
Happy? Why should I be happy?

JERRY
I don't know, but you look like you're happy.

GEORGE
Why should I care?

JERRY
You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when
you're happy.

GEORGE
All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of
you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?
[Elaine sneaks out of Jerry's apartment]

JERRY
Is that so?

GEORGE
Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy,
shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!

JERRY
Disgusting?

GEORGE
People who do that should be arrested.

JERRY
Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.

GEORGE
Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
You shook my hand in that coffee shop.

JERRY
You're still with the pact?

GEORGE
Mmm-hmm. You reneged.

JERRY
All I did was shake your hand.

GEORGE
Ah-ha!

KRAMER
And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.

SOUP NAZI
Ohh! This city.

NEWMAN
One large jambalaya, please.

SOUP NAZI
So, continue.

KRAMER
Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very
emotional.

NEWMAN
Thank you. [inhaling deeply] Jambalaya!

SOUP NAZI
All right, now listen to me. You have been a good friend. I have
an armoire in my basement. If you want to pick it up, you're welcome
to it. So, take it, it's yours.

KRAMER
How can I possibly thank you?

SOUP NAZI
You are the only one who understands me.

KRAMER
You suffer for your soup.

SOUP NAZI
Yes. That is right.

KRAMER
You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.

SOUP NAZI
How can I tolerate any less from my customer?

CUSTOMER
Uh, gazpacho, por favor.

SOUP NAZI
Por favor?

CUSTOMER
Um, I'm part Spanish.

SOUP NAZI
Adios muchacho!

KRAMER
Git.

JERRY
It was stupid of me.

SHEILA
Well, it was very insulting.

JERRY
No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.

SHEILA
Well, behind every joke there's some truth.

JERRY
What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth
to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States
to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get
there and they don't have it he says " Aw, I'll just have some
coffee." There's no truth to that.

SHEILA
Well, I guess you're right.

JERRY
So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?

SHEILA
Yes, shmoopy.

JERRY
Aw!

SUSAN
Hey, Jerry!

JERRY
Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.

GEORGE
Oh, yes. Hello.

SHEILA
Hello. Won't you join us?

GEORGE
No, thanks.

SUSAN
Of course.

GEORGE
Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?

JERRY
Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?

GEORGE
I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one
side...and leave the other side empty.

JERRY
Well, we're changing the rules.

GEORGE
Ahh. Good for you.

SUSAN
Aw, what are you getting George?

GEORGE
I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I
want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I
want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?

SUSAN
Oh, George, you're so sweet.

GEORGE
Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.

SUSAN
Aww!

JERRY
What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little
tuna fishy?

SHEILA
Yeah.

JERRY
Yum yum little tuna fishy?

GEORGE
Come here.
[George & Susan begin making out; Jerry & Sheila begin making out in order
to keep up]

KRAMER
And..voila!

ELAINE
[gasps]

KRAMER
Yeah.

ELAINE
Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!

KRAMER
Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?

ELAINE
The K Man did it!

KRAMER
Yeah!

ELAINE
[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?

KRAMER
How 'bout zero?

ELAINE
What?

KRAMER
Yeah.

ELAINE
What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?

KRAMER
I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously
refer to as the Soup Nazi.

ELAINE
Get out!
[Elaine pushes on Kramer's chest, causing in to fall backwards through her
swinging door]

ELAINE
The Soup Nazi gave it to you?

KRAMER
Yeah.

ELAINE
Why?

KRAMER
Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha --
Yeah. He's a wonderful man.

ELAINE
[gasps]

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....

ELAINE
Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I
mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!

KRAMER
Yeah. Well, he's a dear.

GEORGE
How much tip do you leave on $8.15?

SUSAN
You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so proud of you
today expressing your feelings so freely in front of Jerry and all.
Just knowing that you're not afraid of those things is such a great step
forward in our relationship.

GEORGE
Huh?

SUSAN
[in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't you?

CUSTOMER
How is he today?

BANIA
I think he's in a good mood.

ELAINE
Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful.
I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.

SOUP NAZI
You? If I knew it was for you, I never would have given it to
him in the first place! I would have taken a hatchet and smashed it
to pieces! Now, who wants soup? Next! Speak up!

JERRY
I'm heading over to Elaine's.

KRAMER
Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.

JERRY
Those two?

KRAMER
Yeah.

JERRY
Are you sure?

KRAMER
Yeah. That's them.

JERRY
Well, let's confront 'em.

KRAMER
No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.

JERRY
There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.

KRAMER
No!

JERRY
Let's go.

BOB
Oh, wow look, that one is gorgeous. I would just kill for that one.

RAY
Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all.

BOB
Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because I don't
think you know what you're talking about. Take a look at that.

KRAMER
Excuse me.

RAY
Are you talking to me?

KRAMER
Uh, well, uh, we --

RAY
I said, are you talking to me?

BOB
Well, maybe, he was talking to me. Was you talking to him? Because you
was obviously talking to one of us. So what is it? Who?! Who was you
talking to?!

KRAMER
Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each
other, weren't we?
[Jerry & Kramer turn around and run away]

ELAINE
I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life.
There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi.
What? What is that?

JERRY
I don't know. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of
olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."

ELAINE
Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe
for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes.
These are his recipes!

JERY
So?

ELAINE
So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to
every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could
drop fliers from a plane above the city.

JERRY
Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?

ELAINE
What do you care?

JERRY
Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup
stand. I happen to love that soup.

ELAINE
Get out of my way, Jerry.

JERRY
Elaine, let the man make his soup!

ELAINE
Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.

SUSAN
Look, they have it in blue...for my baby bluey. Are you my baby
bluey?

GEORGE
Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.

JERRY
Well. Well.

SUSAN
Hi, Jerry.

JERRY
Hey, Susan, George.

SUSAN
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.

JERRY
Oh, really?

SUSAN
Mmm-hmm.

JERRY
Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.

SUSAN
Oh, no! That's too bad.

JERRY
Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I
love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.

GEORGE
Really?

JERRY
Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you
obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your
affections in public. See, we had that.

SUSAN
Mmm-hmm.

GEORGE
You did?

JERRY
Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.

GEORGE
Yeah. See ya.

SOUP NAZI
Go on! Leave! Get out!

WOMAN
But I didn't do anything.

SOUP NAZI
Next!

ELAINE
Hello.

SOUP NAZI
You. You think you can get soup? Please. You're wasting
everyone's time.

ELAINE
I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups chopped Porcine
mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."

SOUP NAZI
That is my recipe for wild mushroom.

ELAINE
Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab
chowder, mulligatawny.

SOUP NAZI
Mulliga...tawny?

ELAINE
You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!

NEWMAN
[panting] Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

JERRY
What is it?

NEWMAN
Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!

JERRY
Wha - wha - what's the matter?

NEWMAN
Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow she got
a hold of his recipes and she says she's gonna drive him out of business!
The Soup Nazi said that now that his recipes are out, he's not
gonna make anymore soup! He's moving out of the country, moving to Argentina! No
more soup, Jerry! No more soup for any of us!

JERRY
Well, where are you going?

NEWMAN
He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a big pot!
End.
First scene.
George and Susan are in George's apartment.

SUSAN
Hey, I gotta get some cash, I'm gonna run down to the ATM.

GEORGE
Yeah, I better grab some too.

SUSAN
I'll get it for you; just give me your card.

GEORGE
You sure?

SUSAN
Yeah, just tell me your code.

GEORGE
My code?
 
New scene.
Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.

JERRY
So why didn't you tell her the code?

GEORGE
No. No way.

JERRY
George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.

GEORGE
It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret
code to anyone.'

JERRY
So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?

GEORGE
Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't
there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?

JERRY
Actually, that's the definition of selfish.

GEORGE
Have you ever given your code to anyone?

JERRY
No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'

GEORGE
Superman's father on Krypton.

JERRY
Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up
inside. Sing it, sister.

GEORGE
No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.

JERRY
What if my life depended on it?

GEORGE
If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life,
I'll give you the code.
Jerry stands up and begins limping.

GEORGE
What's the matter with your leg?

JERRY
My foot fell asleep.

GEORGE
How'd your foot fall asleep?

JERRY
I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
A friend of George and Jerry's walks up to the table.

FRED
Hey Jerry.

JERRY
Hey Fred.

GEORGE
Hey Fred.

JERRY
My foot fell asleep.

FRED
You're lucky, at least you got something to do.
Elaine walks in.

JERRY
Fred, do you know Elaine?

FRED
No, it's nice to meet you. Well, I'm outta here, see you guys.

GEORGE
Alright, bye.

JERRY
Seeya.

ELAINE
Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'

JERRY
So?

ELAINE
So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten
minutes.

JERRY
And he didn't remember you?
Elaine gets up to leave.

JERRY
Where are you going, you just got here?

ELAINE
I gotta go talk to him.
 
New scene.
Elaine catches up to Fred on the street.

ELAINE
Excuse me, excuse me, Fred?

FRED
Yeah?

ELAINE
You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.

FRED
We have?

ELAINE
Yeah, at Katie Ash's party?

FRED
What was your name again?

ELAINE
Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my
uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?

FRED
Not ringing a bell.

ELAINE
When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at
him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?

FRED
Mmm, no.

ELAINE
That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.

FRED
The bathroom door. I remember someone had played tic-tac-toe on it, and
the X's won; they went diagonally from the top left to the bottom right.
 
New scene.
Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.

JERRY
Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should
really be fun.
Kramer enters holding a police scanner.

JERRY
Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do
some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry
himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow.

KRAMER
Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.

JERRY
What is that?

KRAMER
Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything: Fires,
harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we
got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up
to be a fireman.

JERRY
Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.

KRAMER
When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that
big hook and ladder.

JERRY
You're lucky they let you drive a car.

KRAMER
No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day
that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.
Kramer runs out, Elaine enters.

ELAINE
What was that?

JERRY
(waving his arm in dismissal) Eh.

ELAINE
Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers
every little thing about that night except me.

JERRY
Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.

ELAINE
What are you saying?

JERRY
Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.

ELAINE
Yeah, but why? I mean, ya know.

JERRY
I know.

ELAINE
Ya know?

JERRY
Yeah, I know.

ELAINE
Huh, lookit, you got the new catalog.

JERRY
Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.

ELAINE
Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to
dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me.

JERRY
Why would I wanna do that?

ELAINE
Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells
these stories, it's gonna be awful.

JERRY
Yeah, sounds like fun.
 
New scene.
George and Susan are at George's apartment.

SUSAN
I want you to tell me, George.

GEORGE
Why? Why is my code so important?

SUSAN
Because, it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust.
We're not supposed to keep secrets from one another.

GEORGE
Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about
your cycles.

SUSAN
My cycles?

GEORGE
Yeah, I never know what's going on there.

SUSAN
Well from now on I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.

GEORGE
Please.

SUSAN
Anything else?

GEORGE
We're out of Bosco!
 
New scene.
Jerry and Leapin' Larry are in the office at the appliance store.

JERRY
Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our
prices, we'll give you the store.

LEAPIN' LARRY
Ya know I've always liked your comedy, you don't take cheap
shots.

JERRY
No I don't.

LEAPIN' LARRY
Sorry for keeping you here so long. Again, I apologize for the
mess. This renovation is killing me.

JERRY (TO HIMSELF)
My foot's asleep again!
Leapin' Larry walks out from behind his desk, he has a severe limp,

LEAPIN' LARRY
When I lost my leg in the boating accident, I got so depressed
about this damn prosthetic I thought I was gonna have to give up the business.
But now I'm rejuvenated. Let me show you around the store.

JERRY
You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
Jerry stands and begins to 'walk off' his sleeping foot. A Leapin' Larry's
employee begins laughing.

EMPLOYEE
That is a great impression!
Leapin' Larry walks in, sees Jerry, and is obviously disappointed. Jerry is
embarrassed.

JERRY
Larry, wait, you don't understand!
 
New scene.
Jerry and Kramer are in Jerry's apartment.

KRAMER
I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is
that what you've sunk to?

JERRY
I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.

KRAMER
Oh, oh your foot fell asleep.

JERRY
Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry,
you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.

KRAMER
Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you,
munjamba?
Jerry's door buzzer rings, Jerry presses the button.

JERRY
Yup.

VOICE
Hup.
A news bulletin is shown on the TV.

KRAMER
Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.

JERRY
Wow, the whole building burned down.

KRAMER
They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got
us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?

JERRY
Of course.

KRAMER
It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.

JERRY
The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
Kramer leaves, George enters.

GEORGE
Where we gonna eat?

JERRY
We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.

GEORGE
Peterman? Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman.

JERRY
Of course not, if I did would you have gone?

GEORGE
No way.

JERRY
There you go.

GEORGE
I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna
have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be
off.

JERRY
Trust me, you're off.
 
New scene.
Elaine bumps into Fred on the street.

ELAINE
Oh, hi Fred.

FRED
Um, hello?

ELAINE
It's Elaine.

FRED
Oh yeah, yeah, right.

ELAINE
How ya doin'?

FRED
I'm depressed. I got this new shirt, the button fell off. Once the
button falls off, that's it. I'll never fix it.

ELAINE
Yeah, that's too bad.

FRED
Yeah, I'm gonna get some vitamins, I feel depleted.

ELAINE
Hmm. I never take them.

FRED
Cause they make you nauseous, right?

ELAINE
Yeah! Yeah, that's right, you remembered!

FRED
Do you wanna have dinner tonight?

ELAINE
Hmm. Tonight.

FRED
What, you have other plans?

ELAINE
No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
 
New scene.
Jerry and George enter a Chinese restaurant, we pick them up in
mid-conversation.

JERRY
...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet.
The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your
ATM code.

GEORGE
Call the Embassy.

JERRY
They're closed.

GEORGE
Why?

JERRY
Bomb threat.

GEORGE
We're in Turkey?

JERRY
Midnight Express, my friend.

GEORGE
My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.
Mr. Peterman walks in.

PETERMAN
You must be Jerry Seinfeld.

JERRY
Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.

PETERMAN
J. Peterman.

GEORGE (GRABBING LAPELS)
J. Crew.

JERRY
Well, is Elaine here?

PETERMAN
Oh, Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll
tell the maitre'd it'll just be the three bulls.

GEORGE
What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?

JERRY
Without Elaine? What for?

GEORGE
What, is he crazy?

JERRY
We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.

GEORGE
I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank.

JERRY
George, what's the matter with you?

GEORGE
I'm choking!

PETERMAN
Ah, Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?

JERRY
Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that
I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.

PETERMAN
I understand, no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company.
Fong? It will just be two this evening. George, we dine.
 
New scene.
Elaine is waiting on the street.

ELAINE (TO HERSELF)
I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?
 
New scene.
George and Peterman are eating dinner. Peterman is in mid-story. George is
disinterested.

PETERMAN
...And there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my
search. The Gwon-Jaya River market, fabrics and spices traded under a starlit
sky. It was there that I discovered the Pamplona beret. Sizes seven-and-a-half
through eight-and-three-quarters. Price? Thirty-five dollars.

GEORGE
Howbout sports? Do you follow sports?
 
New scene.
Jerry's apartment, Jerry has his feet up and a big bowl of popcorn beside him on

gotta love sports!
 
New scene.
Peterman is driving George home.

GEORGE
You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.

PETERMAN
Ha ha, nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you
about my latest trip to Burma where I discovered a very unusual corduroy.
The car phone rings, Peterman answers.

PETERMAN
Peterman here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. (To
George) It's my mother; she's at death's door. I just pray to God we can make
it there in time.
Peterman makes a quick u-turn, pushing George's face into the passenger side
window.
 
New scene.
Elaine is on the phone with Jerry.

JERRY
I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.

ELAINE
Well, Fred asked me out.

JERRY
Fred?

ELAINE
Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.

JERRY
You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't
remember anything about you.

ELAINE
I am? But that's so sick.

JERRY
That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.

ELAINE
Anyway, so how was the dinner?

JERRY
Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the
hell out of there.

ELAINE
What about Georgie?

JERRY
Nah, he didn't make it.
 
New scene.
Peterman's mother's house. She's in bed; Peterman is consulting with the
doctor.

PETERMAN
Doctor, how is she?

DOCTOR
She's too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice.

PETERMAN
Mama, it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama.
She looks off in George's direction.

GEORGE
I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.
 
New scene.
Peterman's mother's apartment. George is sleeping in a chair with a coat
covering him. Peterman wakes him up.

PETERMAN
Shake off the dew, my friend.

GEORGE
Yeah. What time is it?

PETERMAN
It's morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us
a pot of coffee, George. Watch her, won't you?

GEORGE
Who?

PETERMAN
Momma. Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it
helps.
Peterman leaves, George attempts conversation.

GEORGE
Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fianc, you know, we, uh,
we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my
secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I
would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna
know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that
stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a
relief!

MRS. PETERMAN
Bosco. Bosco.

GEORGE
Oh, shhh.

MRS. PETERMAN (SITTING UP)
Bosco!

PETERMAN (FROM ANOTHER ROOM)
Momma?
George" Quiet, quiet! It's a secret.

MRS. PETERMAN
Bosco! Bosco! Bosco!

GEORGE
Shut up! Shut up!
Peterman runs in.

PETERMAN
Momma! What are you trying to say?

MRS. PETERMAN
Bosco.
Mrs. Peterman falls back in bed and closes her eyes.

PETERMAN
She's gone. Bosco?
Peterman looks at George, who shrugs.
 
New scene.
George and Jerry are in Jerry's apartment.

GEORGE
You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't
bailed out on me at the restaurant.

JERRY
I did not bail out on you.

GEORGE
Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?

JERRY
Why didn't you come up with your own?

GEORGE
I froze. I think I'm losing it.

JERRY
Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?

GEORGE
No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.
Kramer enters.

GEORGE
Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.

JERRY
Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?

GEORGE
I am not giving you my code.

KRAMER
I'll bet I can guess it.

GEORGE
Pssh. Yeah. Right.

KRAMER
Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out
birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a
word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well,
you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?

GEORGE
Huh?

KRAMER
You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your
pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet
tooth.

GEORGE
Get out of here.

KRAMER
Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the
cocoa bean.

GEORGE
I'm leaving.

KRAMER (BUILDING UP STEAM AS GEORGE BOLTS FOR THE DOOR)
No, and only the
purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!

GEORGE
I gotta go.

KRAMER
If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!

GEORGE
Shut up!

KRAMER
Nestl's Quik!

GEORGE
Shut up!
 
New scene.
Elaine and George are at the funeral.

GEORGE
What was that?

ELAINE
What?

GEORGE
You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?

ELAINE
I got a date.
Mr. Peterman walks up.

ELAINE
Oh, Mr. Peterman.

PETERMAN
Oh, Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been
trying to communicate something, a legacy, a dying wish perhaps.

GEORGE
Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy
person.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've
gotta get going.

PETERMAN
You do?

GEORGE

I have a personal commitment.

GEORGE
Well, personal, I mean, we both uh...

PETERMAN
What is it?

ELAINE
I'm speaking at a women's' rights conference.

GEORGE
Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.

PETERMAN
I don't believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you
to stop by.

ELAINE
My pleasure.

PETERMAN
Fortunately, I still have George here to help me through this.
Elaine leaves.

PETERMAN
You know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor
that momma had taken a lover. Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.

Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!

JERRY
Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.

KRAMER
Oh, so he took you back.

Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.

JERRY
No I didn't.
 
New scene.
Kramer is at the fire station, talking with the Captain.

CAPTAIN
Well, Mr. Kramer, your list of short cuts is most impressive.

KRAMER
Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the
Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.

Mr. Kramer, just about every week some brash young hothead like
yourself saunters in here talking about faster routes and snazzier colors for
the trucks, well, fact is we feel things are fine the way they are.

show you around the store.

JERRY
Oh sure.
Jerry stands up to find his leg is asleep.

JERRY
Uh, again? (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there.
Jerry stomps his foot on the floor a few times before he leaves, he accidentally
bumps a paint can which knocks over a can of flammable liquid which spills onto

Stay out of this, Kramer.
Kramer sees the firemen slide down the pole and he gives it a try. As he lands
he bumps one of the firemen into the truck, then to the floor in a daze.

KRAMER
Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?

FIREMAN (GROGGY)
I drive the back of the truck.

Sorry about the other night but my mother called, she couldn't find her
pills. I had to go into Brooklyn to help her find her pills, and they were
right there in the medicine cabinet. Could you believe that?

ELAINE
Huh.

FRED
The worst part is getting from the subway station to the house. There's
no transportation...

ELAINE (TO HERSELF)
What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he
didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...

FRED
...I could have taken a cab but if my mother saw me pull up in a cab,
she'd start yelling at me, "Freddy! What are taking a cab for? It's so
expensive!" She's out of her mind. Eventually, you'll meet her.

But my sleeve, it's stuck in the machine, it ate my card!

PETERMAN
George, give me your ATM card!

GEORGE
I don't have my ATM card.

PETERMAN
George, you're obviously lying, anyone can see that!
George pulls out his wallet, Peterman grabs the card, fits it into the slot and
tries the door.

PETERMAN
It's jammed! I'll slide it under the door,
The man grabs the card and slams it into the machine.
 

MAN

GEORGE
What?! Why?

MAN
The machine won't open without the code!

Oh my god. Look at this.

GEORGE
Hm?

PERRY
It's the new J. Peterman catalog. Look.
Jerry hands the catalog to George.

GEORGE
The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little
secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother.
End.
Opening monologue.
I’d like to know when Tic-Tac-Toe became the Pound sign, that's what I’d
like to know. Why don't they call it what it really is -- “Leave your
numeric message now and then press Archie’s head.”
And what is that redial button? Let's face it -- you're either going to
get the person, the machine or they have call waiting. Who is redialing
and redialing? This is like the harassment key for people in a fight,
you know.
(Jerry holds his right hand up to the side of his face, thumb and pinky
extended like a phone receiver)
“Hey I’m not through --” CLICK. Blulululululu.
“You can't do that to me --” CLICK. Blulululululu.
“And another thing --” CLICK. Blulululululu.

Opening scene.

GEORGE
Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you
and me?

JERRY
Well, what do you mean?

GEORGE
Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you
know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?

JERRY
Well I think that's pretty obvious.

GEORGE
Yeah. Me too.
(Elaine enters carrying a cup of coffee)

JERRY
Hey Elaine.

ELAINE
Hey.

JERRY
Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and
ah, gorgeous George here. (pointing up and down at George)

ELAINE
You mean in a real Fight Fight?

JERRY
Mona a Baldo.

ELAINE
George.

GEORGE
Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator)

JERRY
Why?

George fights dirty. (she sips her coffee)

JERRY
Really? What would you do?

GEORGE
Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he
opens a blue bottled beverage)

JERRY
Hmm.

ELAINE
So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you?
Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the
Met.

JERRY
I’m sorry.

ELAINE
George?

GEORGE
Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?

ELAINE
There's nobody I can go with.
(Kramer enters)

ELAINE
You know what. I don't have one female friend left.

KRAMER
Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate
other women, and they hate you.

ELAINE
Thank you.

KRAMER
So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we
going to the movies?

JERRY
Ah, how about 8:30?

KRAMER
Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food
-- takes a big bite)

JERRY
You want to get something to eat first?

KRAMER
[ mumbling with full mouth ] No, I’m good.

GEORGE
I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee
table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands)
heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the
door and rushes out)

KRAMER
There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, who’s afraid of
a woman. (voice get high-pitched for the last line)

JERRY
Hey, why don't cha ask Susan?

ELAINE
George's Susan?

JERRY
Yeah.

ELAINE
Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks
her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, I’ll see you
guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)

KRAMER
That's gunna be trouble.

JERRY
Why?

KRAMER
Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's
sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's
collide. You know what happens then?
(Kramer raises his hands into the air and slowly brings them together in
an explosion. He's holding some food in one hand, so when his hands
come into contact food flies all over)

“really?”)

ELAINE
Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.

GEORGE
Oh, I don't think you want to do that.

ELAINE
Why not?

GEORGE
Well what would be the point of that?
(Susan, hearing her name glances over at George)

ELAINE
George, are you going to put her on the phone?

GEORGE
Where did this come from all of a sudden?

ELAINE
George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?

GEORGE
I really think I should have been consulted about this.
(George takes the phone from his ear and walks over to the couch and
hands the phone to Susan)

GEORGE
Here ... something.

SUSAN
Hello? (with hesitant surprise) Oh, that sounds great. I love
that sort of stuff.

clenched up to his mouth. He takes off his glasses, puts his left hand
just above his eyes and rubs them in disbelief and walks out of the
room.)

Over there. (points to the next seat over)

KRAMER
Why?

JERRY
Little buffer zone.

KRAMER
(Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat)

JERRY
Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a
movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?

KRAMER
No. You got a point.

JERRY
All right.

KRAMER
I can't ...

JERRY
What are you doing?

KRAMER
Well these seats have no lumbar.

JERRY
Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
(Ramon is looking for a seat. He's carrying a drink, a bunch of
napkins, and a huge bucket of popcorn)

KRAMER
We are talking.

JERRY
Pretend it's interesting.

KRAMER
So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are
still looking for me.

Oh, hey Ramon.

RAMON
Hey, hey, I took a bunch of napkins. You want some?

JERRY
Oh, no thanks. (turns back to Kramer)

RAMON
Hey, ahhh, is this seat taken?
(Ramon proceeds to sit down between Kramer and Jerry)

JERRY

like he can't believe Ramon sat down. Ramon is bobbing his head front
to back with his neck, like sitting there worked out pretty good)

George are talking.

JERRY
And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us

said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.

GEORGE
By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?

JERRY
No why?

GEORGE

JERRY
Oh yeah, I know.

GEORGE
How do you know?

JERRY
Well it was my idea.

GEORGE
Your idea?

JERRY
Yeah.

GEORGE
Wha’d you do that for?

JERRY
She was looking for someone to go to the show with.

GEORGE
Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to
happen now?

JERRY
World's collide. (points at George)

GEORGE
Whe ... Well yeah!

JERRY
Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into
contact with --

GEORGE
YES! It Blows Up! So if you know that, what did you tell
Elaine for?

JERRY
I didn’t know. Kramer told me about the worlds.

GEORGE
You couldn't figure out the “World's Theory” for yourself? It's
just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart.
(gesturing with hands going outward)

JERRY
Yeah, I guess I slipped up.

ELAINE
You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city?
That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.

New scene.
Exterior of Elaine's building. Elaine and Jerry walk down the steps and
on to the sidewalk.

JERRY
It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of
days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's
always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...

ELAINE
Uh-huh.

JERRY
And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.

ELAINE
Uhh, so frustrating!

JERRY
Tell me about it.

ELAINE
Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee
shop?

JERRY
You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?

ELAINE
Yeah.

JERRY
I’m meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.

ELAINE
Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.
(Elaine walks off, while Jerry stands there contemplating the upcoming
ramifications)
New scene.
Elaine and Jerry enter Monk’s coffee shop as Susan sits across the booth
from Kramer.

SUSAN
Hey! Elaine! Jerry. Over here!

KRAMER
There they are.

SUSAN
Yeah, look who I ran into.

KRAMER
Hey.

ELAINE
Yeah. (sits down next to Susan)

KRAMER
Yeah.

ELAINE
Ahh.
(Jerry stands a few paces from the booth, looking around for George, and
feeling uncomfortable about the upcoming events)

KRAMER
Come on Jerry. Aren't you going to join us?

JERRY
Ah, you know. I’m supposed to meet, eh, someone -- I’ll, I’ll
wait for them outside. (walks towards the door)

KRAMER
Yeah, wait here. Come on, sit down. What's the matter with
you?

JERRY
This is gonna to be ugly. (quietly)
(Jerry sits down next to Kramer)

SUSAN
What's that Jerry?

JERRY
[coughing] I said, boy am I ugly.
(George enters the coffee shop)

SUSAN
Oh, hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here.
(George walks in and stops, looking at the four of them sitting in the
booth. He nods his head and extends his arm in acknowledgment, nods his
head again, he lightly claps his hands and walks up to the table)

GEORGE
One, two ... three, four.
(extending his arm and counting to Elaine, Susan, Kramer and Jerry, who
he puts his hand under Jerry's chin and then makes a fist and presses it
to Jerry's cheek)

GEORGE
Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door)

SUSAN
Hey George!

JERRY
We'll pull up another chair.
New scene.
Exterior of Reggie’s diner, then inside where George sits alone in a
booth. He eats in silence. A man sits at the counter, sipping coffee.
New scene.
Exterior shot of the Physique health club, then inside to the pool.
Jerry is swimming while Ramon is cleaning the pool with a large squeegee
on a long pole.

JERRY
I see you there Ramon.
(Ramon jabs a little bit at Jerry with the squeegee)

JERRY
Hey, l‘ll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. I’m not done. I know
what you're up to Ramon. Because I’m a member here, this is my place to
swim.
(Ramon pushes the squeegee out into Jerry's swim path -- Jerry grabs the
squeegee pole and they struggle in a push-pull match)

JERRY
Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.
(Ramon loses his balance and Jerry pulls him into the pool)

RAMON
Oh.
(Newman runs towards the pool in one of those old time bathing suits)

NEWMAN
Olly, olly, oxen, free!
(It looks like Newman tries to do a cannonball into the pool, filmed in
slow motion. Ramon looks up with a stunned look on his face, seeing
Newman as he jumps into the pool on top of him.)

JERRY
[NO!]
Camera fade to Ramon, lying unconscious on the tile pool deck. Newman
and Jerry are kneeling over him.

JERRY
I think he's gonna need, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

NEWMAN
Mouth-to-mouth?

JERRY
Yeah.

NEWMAN
Huh.

JERRY
Well? Go ahead.

NEWMAN
You go.

JERRY
You knocked him out.

NEWMAN
Yeah, but you pulled him in.

JERRY
Come on Newman. Do it.

NEWMAN
Nah.

JERRY
He might die.

NEWMAN
Yeah. Maybe.
New scene.
Night exterior of George's apartment building, then inside where Susan
and Elaine are sitting and talking.

ELAINE
(on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater.

(HANGS UP THE PHONE) OK, NEXT SHOWINGS AT 9
0, we can't wait any
longer.

SUSAN
Elaine, where could he be? It's not like George to just
disappear.

ELAINE
Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?

SUSAN
Oh, I don't know.

ELAINE
Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and
writes) “George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry.”
Love?

SUSAN
Yeah.

ELAINE
“Love ... Susan.”
New scene.
Camera fade to Elaine, Susan and Jerry outside the Paragon movie
theater. It's night as they wait in line to buy tickets.

JERRY
So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him
mouth-to-mouth.

ELAINE
He could have died

JERRY
Yeah, it was a gamble.

SUSAN
Why didn’t you give him mouth-to-mouth?

JERRY
Ah. (makes face)

ELAINE
How can you possibly show your face there again?

JERRY
Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know,
we can't go anywhere near there.
(they move up to the ticket window)

ELAINE
Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking
towards Jerry)
New scene.
Night exterior of George's apartment building, then inside where George
finds the note.

GEORGE
What the hell is this? “George, Elaine and I went to see
Chunnel ... with Jerry.” With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great!
(dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go
with Jerry.
[Rings]

KRAMER

You've selected ... Agent Zero? If that's correct, press one.

GEORGE
What?

KRAMER
Ah, you've selected ... Brown-Eyed Girl? If this is correct,

selected.

GEORGE
Chunnel?

KRAMER
To find the theater nearest you, please enter your five digit
zip-code, now.

CINEMA IN THE MAIN THEATER AT 9
0 PM.

GEORGE
Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the
door)

KRAMER
It's also playing in theater number two at 9:00.
New scene.
Night exterior of United Artists Theater with a busy street in the
foreground -- taxi's drive by. Then inside to a darkened theater,
George, in the isle, searches for Jerry, Elaine and Susan. He's trying
to be quiet and still get their attention.

GEORGE
Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here.
Elaine! Susan!

MOVIE PATRON
SHH!

(FROM THE MOVIE WE HEAR THIS DIALOGUE
“The English Channel Tunnel,
Chunnel, runs 32.3 miles, with two openings. One here, in England and
another one here, in France. That's all we got. Thank you for your
time gentlemen. Can I ask you a question Mr. McKittrick.”
-- it's a bit hard to hear the movie dialogue, as we are supposed to be
focused on George, but I was able to make out most of it)
New scene.
Cut to Susan, Elaine and Jerry watching Chunnel in the theater next
door. Jerry is eating popcorn while Elaine sips a drink and eats a bit
of popcorn

JERRY
I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the
plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?

SUSAN
No, no. That's not the guy. That's a different guy.
(Susan looks irritated at Jerry and Elaine's talking)

JERRY
What is he doing in the Chunnel?

SUSAN
Would you two, Please?
(movie voice - clearly it's Larry David's voice) [ Everybody out of the
Chunnel! Everybody out! ]
(Elaine and Jerry stop eating, sink back into their seats and look at
each other, with silent expressions that say “what is her problem.”)

(AGAIN, FROM THE MOVIE WE HEAR THIS DIALOGUE
“Let me tell you
something about the Chunnel, Mr. Thane. That our only freeway is
adept. [inaudible] Elaine Brookstone will get the money bag
[inaudible] Not as long as I have these long stickers. Find him and
Kill him! I don't care if we have to turn this Chunnel upside down!
Find Him! Everybody out of the Chunnel! Everybody out! The Chunnel’s
gonna blow! AHHHHHH [Explosion]”
** this time it's really tough to make all of it out, so there are some
inaudible parts, but I tried to pick up most of it)
New Scene.
back to George in the other theater. He stands at the front of the
theater, the movie screen behind and above him. He is still trying to
find Jerry, Elaine and Susan.

GEORGE
Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me!

MOVIE PATRON
[Hey, sit down!]

GEORGE
Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves!

MOVIE PATRON
[Hey, we're trying to watch a movie here!]

GEORGE
Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at
me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry!
Reggies!

MOVIE PATRON
[Move it off of there!]

GEORGE
Where are you!

2ND MOVIE PATRON
[Hey are you sure you got the right theater?]

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chunnel. Susan!

2ND MOVIE PATRON
[It's playing in two theaters.]

GEORGE
Two theaters?

2ND MOVIE PATRON
[Yeah, there's a 9:00 too.]

GEORGE
Oh. Sorry.
New Scene.
Elaine, Susan and Jerry exit the theater.

ELAINE
I thought that was pretty good, huh?

JERRY
Wha’d you think Susan?

SUSAN
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't hear anything. You, you talked the
whole movie.

ELAINE
Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?

JERRY
Yeah.

SUSAN
Ah, no. I don't think so.

ELAINE
Why not?

SUSAN
Well you know, all you guys ever do is sit around the coffee shop
talking, sit around Jerry's apartment talking. Frankly, I don't know
how you can stand it. I’ll see you.
(Susan turns to walk away, but stops and looks at George being escorted
out of the theater by two ushers. He struggles to try and stay inside
the theater, but they forcefully remove him. Jerry, Elaine and Susan
watch as George it escorted out -- he does not see the three of them
standing there.)

GEORGE
I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me.
Together, laughing and lying.

USHER
Let's go pal.

GEORGE
They're -- They're killing independent George! And they're,
they're all in on it! World's are colliding!
[Camera freeze on George with the two ushers -- and into commercial]
Final scene.

OUTSIDE KRAMER’S APARTMENT DOOR
5B A partial view of a man's face and
his hand knocks 3 times on the door.

MOVIE PHONE GUY
Hello, and welcome to your worst nightmare.
(Kramer, sitting on the couch, reading the paper and eating cereal is
obviously startled by the voice at his door)

MOVIE PHONE GUY
(con’t) I know your in there, Cosmo Kramer, Apartment
5B. You're in big trouble, Now. You've been sealing my business. If
you'd like to do this the easy way, open the door, Now. Or, please
select the number of seconds, you'd like to wait, before I break this
door down. Please select Now.
(as the Movie Phone Guy talks, Kramer slides off the couch and ducks
down under the coffee table, then pops back up with a dazed look.)
End.

JERRY'S STAND-UP
I have a friend, wears eye glasses, no prescription in the glasses because he thinks it makes him look more intelligent, now why? Why do we think that glasses makes us look more intelligent? Is it from the endless hours of reading and studying and researching that this person supposedly blew out their eyeballs, and that's why they need the glasses? It's just a corrective device. If you see someone with a hearing aid, you don't think, 'Oh, they must have been listening real good...yeah, to a lot of important stuff...' No, they are deaf. They can't hear.
Opening scene - Jerry and Elaine in a booth at Monk's. Kramer comes over from the counter with a clipboard in his hand.

KRAMER
Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS walk.

ELAINE
Is that tomorrow?

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...<gestures to Elaine to sign the form.>

ELAINE (SIGNING)
Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS.

KRAMER
Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

JERRY (SIGNING)
It's hard enough living next door.

KRAMER
I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. <gets up> I'll be right back.
<Jerry stands up and gets a bottle of ketchup from the next table.>

ELAINE
New jeans?

JERRY
Yeah.

ELAINE
Still a 31 waist?

JERRY
Yep. Since college. <Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.> Hey, Lena Small's on this list.

ELAINE
Lena Small?

JERRY
Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.

ELAINE
Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!

JERRY (COPYING DOWN THE NUMBER)
Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring to date a giving person.

ELAINE
You're a taking person.

JERRY
That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.

ELAINE (WARNS)
She's gonna ask how you got her number.

JERRY
Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.

ELAINE
What's he look like?

JERRY
I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.

ELAINE
You're buying a speedboat?

JERRY
See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. <Elaine laughs.> All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.

ELAINE
I don't know about that.

JERRY
So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?

ELAINE
Well...

JERRY
Yeah. So you really like this guy.

ELAINE
Very much.

JERRY
How's the...sexual chemistry?

ELAINE
Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. <Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.>

KRAMER
Are you still on the pill?

ELAINE
Uh, Kramer...

KRAMER
I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.

ELAINE
The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge.

KRAMER
But wasn't that taken off the market?

ELAINE
Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.

KRAMER
I read it in Wall Street Week...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
<Elaine laughs.>
 
Commercial break.
New scene - Jerry on the phone in his apartment.

JERRY
Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...
 
New scene - George and Susan in George's car.

SUSAN
You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's really thin.

GEORGE
Not as thin as you think.

SUSAN
Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.

GEORGE
The tag, huh?

SUSAN
Mmm-hmm.

GEORGE
Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.

SUSAN
What are you talking about?

GEORGE
He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.

SUSAN
Oh, how could he be so vain?

GEORGE
Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.

SUSAN (LAUGHING)
Why not?

GEORGE
Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know.

SUSAN
Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell me everything.

GEORGE
Where did you get that from?

SUSAN
Well, we're a couple. It's understood.

GEORGE
I never heard of that.

SUSAN
Well, you've never been a couple.

GEORGE
I've coupled! I've coupled!

SUSAN
Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.

GEORGE
This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!
New scene - George arrives at Jerry's apartment.

GEORGE
Hey.

JERRY
Hey. What's the matter?

GEORGE
I had a fight with Susan.

JERRY
What about?

GEORGE
Oh...<is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders> ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?

JERRY
I got a date with that girl, Lena.

GEORGE
Lena, how'd you meet her?

JERRY
I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... <Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.>

GEORGE
You met her a few weeks ago, but...?

JERRY (SLOWLY)
I didn't call her till today.

GEORGE
So, uh...wanna double?

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.

JERRY
I dunno. <Elaine enters.> Hey.

ELAINE
Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.

JERRY
So what are you gonna do?

ELAINE
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.

GEORGE
Just for these sponges?

ELAINE
Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?

GEORGE
I dunno.

ELAINE
You don't know?

GEORGE
I, uh...figure it's something. <Kramer enters.>

JERRY
What are you all out of breath from?

KRAMER (PANTING)
The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.

JERRY
And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.

KRAMER
Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!

JERRY
I got a 31 waist, mister!

KRAMER
Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?

JERRY (PROUDLY)
What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers.
New scene - a musical montage of Elaine's "hard-target search" - visiting stores and pharmacies all over town and not finding a sponge anywhere. She ends up at the Pasteur Pharmacy.

PHARMACIST
Can I help you?

ELAINE (WITH LITTLE HOPE)
Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know they're off the market, but...

PHARMACIST
Actually, we have a case left.

ELAINE (EXCITED)
A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. Uh...how many come in a case?

PHARMACIST
Sixty.

ELAINE
Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three.

PHARMACIST
Three.

ELAINE
Make it ten.

PHARMACIST
Ten?

ELAINE
Twenty sponges should be plenty.

PHARMACIST
Did you say twenty?

ELAINE
Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine.

PHARMACIST
Right. So, you're set with twenty-five.

ELAINE
Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
New scene - Jerry and Lena having dinner in a restaurant with George and Susan.

JERRY
Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.

LENA (SMELLS JERRY'S ARM)
Mmm! Very nice.

JERRY
It's All-Tempa-Cheer.

LENA
I use Planet. It's bio-degradable and doesn't pollute the oceans.

GEORGE
Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.

LENA (TO WAITER)
Can you wrap up all the left-overs on the table, please? I always take the left-overs. I work in a soup kitchen every morning at 6 a.m.

JERRY
They serve soup at 6 a.m.?

LENA
Yeah. That's all they have.

JERRY
Do the bums ever complain? "Soup again?"

GEORGE
I'd get tired of it.

JERRY
How could you not?

LENA
Guess who volunteered last week?

GEORGE
Mick Jagger.

LENA
No. Maya Angelou.

SUSAN
Oh, the poet!

JERRY (TO LENA)
So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup three times a day?

LENA
I don't know.

SUSAN (TO LENA)
So, did you get to talk to her?

LENA
Talk to who?

JERRY
Is it a lot of cream soups?

SUSAN
Maya Angelou, the poet.

LENA
No, I didn't get the chance.

GEORGE
Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
<Jerry gives George a surprised look. George looks back, puzzled.>

SUSAN
I'm going to the ladies room.

LENA
I'll go with you. <They leave.>

GEORGE
What are you looking at me like that for?

JERRY
Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?

GEORGE
What are you talking about?

JERRY
Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.
<George's interest is peaked.>
New scene - George and Susan in the car on the way home.

SUSAN
Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's awful!

GEORGE
I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.

SUSAN
But you told me anyway?

GEORGE
Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.

SUSAN
Thank you, honey.

GEORGE
So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?

SUSAN
Can we stop by a drug store first?

GEORGE
What for?

SUSAN
I'm out of birth control stuff.

GEORGE
Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? <Pulls over.>

SUSAN
Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in.

GEORGE
Me run in? Why don't you run in?

SUSAN
You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?

GEORGE
Of course I do.

SUSAN
You do? What?

GEORGE
You know. You use the, uh...<mutters something unintelligible under his breath.>

SUSAN
The what?

GEORGE
You know, the uh...<mutters it again.>

SUSAN
Just get me some sponges, please.

GEORGE
Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.

SUSAN
Off the market? The sponge?

GEORGE
Yeah, so you gotta use something else.

SUSAN
I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!

GEORGE
O.k....<thinks> I think I know where we can get one.
New scene - Jerry approaching his apartment door. He hears the sound of a loud group of people from inside Kramer's place. He knocks on Kramer's door. Kramer answers.

JERRY
Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?

KRAMER
It's a poker game...<yells to the crowd> And I'm kickin' some serious butt!

JERRY
Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!

VOICE FROM POKER GAME
Hey, Kramer - are you in?

KRAMER
Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? Do they look scared?!

JERRY
You're never gonna make it!

New scene - Elaine and Billy in Elaine's apartment, kissing passionately on the sofa.

BILLY
You, uh...you wanna go in the bedroom?

ELAINE
O.k. Hold on just a second. <Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.>

GEORGE
Elaine? It's me, George. <Elaine opens the door.> Hey, sorry to bother you so late. <To Billy> Hey! How ya doin.' <To Elaine> Uh, did you get any of those sponges?

ELAINE
Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?

GEORGE
Well...Susan.

ELAINE
Ah, Susan uses the sponge.

GEORGE
Susan loves the sponge.

ELAINE
Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.

GEORGE
What?

ELAINE
I can't do it. No way, there's no how. <Tries to push George out the door. George resists.>

GEORGE
Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?

ELAINE
Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. <Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.>

GEORGE
Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.

ELAINE
I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. <Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.> (To Billy) Hold that thought!
<Elaine goes into the bathroom for a sponge, but then stops and reconsiders.>
 
New scene - Susan talking on the phone with Monica.

Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just -

LENA
It's o.k.! There's nothing to be sorry about. I don't mind.

JERRY
You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?

LENA
No, not at all. No problem. <Jerry looks at Lena suspiciously. Lena leaves with all of Kramer's poker buddies, who are filing out of Kramer's apartment.>

KRAMER
Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants on!

JERRY
You went all night?

KRAMER (SHOWS JERRY HIS WINNINGS)
Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh?

JERRY
Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!

KRAMER
AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. <George enters.> Hey!

JERRY
So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.

GEORGE
Really? How'd she do that?

JERRY
A friend of a friend of Susan's.

GEORGE
My Susan?

JERRY
Why'd you tell her?!

GEORGE
Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!

JERRY
Well you know what this means, don't you?

GEORGE
What?

You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!

GEORGE
C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again.

JERRY
If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?

GEORGE
Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.

JERRY
I don't know, George.

GEORGE
So, Lena was upset, huh?

JERRY
You know what? That was the amazing thing.

GEORGE
What, it didn't bother her?

JERRY
No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.

GEORGE
What?

JERRY
She's too good.

GEORGE
Too good...

JERRY
I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!

GEORGE
I see what you mean.

JERRY
I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.

GEORGE
Where's the depravity?

JERRY
No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.
<Elaine enters.>

JERRY (USING ELAINE AS AN EXAMPLE)
On the other hand...

ELAINE
What?

GEORGE (TO ELAINE)
Thanks again for last night!

ELAINE
Hey, I didn't even use one.

JERRY
I thought you said it was imminent.

ELAINE
Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.

JERRY
Sponge-worthy?

ELAINE
Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.

JERRY
But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?

ELAINE
Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.

GEORGE
You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!
 
New scene - Kramer signing in at the AIDS walk.

KRAMER (TO ORGANIZER AT DESK)
Uh, Cosmo Kramer?

ORGANIZER
Uh...o.k., you're checked in. Here's your AIDS ribbon.

KRAMER
Uh, no thanks.

ORGANIZER
You don't want to wear an AIDS ribbon?

KRAMER
No.

ORGANIZER
But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon.

KRAMER
I have to?

ORGANIZER
Yes.

KRAMER
See, that's why I don't want to.

ORGANIZER
But everyone wears the ribbon. You must wear the ribbon!

KRAMER
You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. <Walks away.>

ORGANIZER
Hey you! Come back here! Come back here and put this on!
 
New scene - George and Susan in a booth at the coffee shop.

GEORGE
Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.

SUSAN
Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms.

GEORGE
Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.

SUSAN
Just once...for the make-up sex.

GEORGE
Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.

SUSAN
Come on, just once?

GEORGE
No, no...I hate the condom.

SUSAN
Why?

GEORGE
I can never get the package open in time.

SUSAN
Well, you just tear it open.

GEORGE
It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's a lot of pressure there.
 
New scene - Kramer in the AIDS walk.

WALKER #1
Hey, where's your ribbon?

KRAMER
Oh, I don't wear the ribbon.

WALKER #2
Oh, you don't wear the ribbon? Aren't you against AIDS?

KRAMER
Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.

WALKER #3
Who do you think you are?

WALKER #1
Put the ribbon on!

WALKER #2
Hey, Cedric! Bob! This guy won't wear a ribbon! <Cedric and Bob turn around and glare at Kramer.>

BOB
Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? <Kramer is frightened.>
 
New scene - Elaine and Billy in her apartment.

ELAINE
So, you think you're sponge-worthy?

BILLY
Yes, I think I'm sponge-worthy. I think I'm very sponge-worthy.

ELAINE
Run down your case for me again...?

BILLY
Well, we've gone out several times, we obviously have a good rapport. I own a very profitable electronics distributing firm. I eat well. I exercise. Blood tests - immaculate. And if I can speak frankly, I'm actually quite good at it.

ELAINE
You going to do something about your sideburns?

BILLY
Yeah, I told you...I'm going to trim my sideburns.

ELAINE
And the bathroom in your apartment?

BILLY
Cleaned it this morning.

ELAINE
The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?

BILLY
Everything, yeah. It's spotless.

ELAINE
Alright, let's go. <They head for the bedroom.>
 
New scene - Jerry arrives at Lena's apartment.

JERRY
Hi.

LENA
Hi! Hey, look at this - I just got a citation in the mail for my work with shut-ins.

JERRY
Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.

LENA
Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream soups.

JERRY
Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -

LENA
Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the water running. <Goes into the bathroom.> Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel out of my bedroom closet?

JERRY
Oh, o.k. <Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.>

JERRY'S BRAIN
Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! <Grabs a towel and brings it to Lena.> There you are.

LENA
Thanks. So, you were saying...?

JERRY
What? Nothing.

LENA
No, you said I was a good person...

JERRY
Oh...

LENA
You seem like you want to tell me something.

JERRY
Tell you something...I do.

LENA
What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything.

JERRY
Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?

LENA
Yeah.

JERRY
I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. <Lena is puzzled.>
 
New scene - George and Susan in bed. We see George's hands struggling to open a condom wrapper.

SUSAN
Come on, George, just tear it open.

GEORGE
I'm trying, dammit.

SUSAN
Tear it.

GEORGE
I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.

SUSAN
Here give it to me.

GEORGE
Would you wait a second? Just wait? <They fight over it.>

SUSAN
Give it to me. <She rips it open.> Come on. Come on!

GEORGE (TOSSES THE CONDOM ASIDE)
It's too late.
 
New scene - Kramer surrounded by Cedric, Bob, and the other walkers.

BOB
So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?

KRAMER (NERVOUSLY)
No! Never.

BOB
But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?

KRAMER
This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!

CEDRIC
What are we gonna do with him?

BOB
I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!
<Kramer tries to climb up a fire escape, but the mob grabs him and pulls him back down. Kramer screams.>
 
New scene - Jerry and George waiting for Kramer at the finish line.

JERRY
It completely turned her off.

GEORGE
Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?

JERRY
I don't wanna be a 32.

GEORGE
I'd kill to be a 32.

JERRY
She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!

GEORGE
That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?

JERRY
It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.

GEORGE
You never run out, do you? <Jerry smiles.> Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.

JERRY
Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
<They see Kramer staggering towards them with cuts and bruises, clothes torn, one shoe off. He collapses and crawls across the finish line.>

JERRY
Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. <Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.>

GEORGE
Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?
<Kramer looks at George unbelievingly.>
 
Commercial break.
New scene - Elaine and Billy in bed the next morning.

ELAINE (SMILING)
Good morning.

BILLY
How'd you sleep?

ELAINE (STRETCHES)
Great. You?

BILLY
Fine, fine. Everything o.k.?

ELAINE
Yep.

BILLY
No regrets?

ELAINE
Nope. <Billy leans in to kiss her.> What are you doing?

BILLY
What do you mean?

ELAINE
Oh...I don't think so.

BILLY
Why not? I thought you said everything was fine.

ELAINE
I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. <Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.>
End.
[Nightclub]
Jerry's opening standup monologue.

JERRY
(unwrapping a piece of gum) I think gum is, is one of the weirdest human
inventions. (pops gum in his mouth) It's not a liquid, 's not a solid, 's not a
food. What is it? It isn't really anything, you know. I mean, it's like a
stationary bike for your jaw. Like, remember when you were in school, and
teachers would get all riled up if they caught you with gum? And when you were a
kid, you'd think 'What is the big deal?' But, as an adult, I can understand it,
because when you're chewing gum, you don't look like you're too thrilled with
anything anyone has to say. (as sarcastic teen) 'Oh, World War Two. That was an
important historical event? Yeah, I'm sure.' 'They landed a man on the moon,
nineteen sixty-nine? Yeah, right. Yeah, I buy that, teach.'
[Monks']
Jerry and George sitting in a booth, much as usual.

GEORGE
You think she's happy?

JERRY
Who?

GEORGE
(indicates with his head) The cashier.

JERRY
Ruthie Cohen?

GEORGE
(surprised) You know her name?

JERRY
Sure.

GEORGE
I don't think I've ever spoken to her.

JERRY
Maybe that's why she's happy.
Kramer enters. He has a handful of flyers.

KRAMER
(handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen.

JERRY
What is this?

KRAMER
(removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex
Theatre.

JERRY
That stinky old movie-house?

KRAMER
(sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the
place.

GEORGE
(gesturing with flyer) With Spartacus?

KRAMER
(lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his
burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if
you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.

JERRY
Geoffrey who?

KRAMER
Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some
fascinating insights into the production.

GEORGE
Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?

KRAMER
Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in
the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill?
(looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm
supposed to meet him here.

GEORGE
Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?

KRAMER
Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the
theatre landmark status.

JERRY
I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.

KRAMER
Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to
spend a few months in an institution.

GEORGE
Really?

KRAMER
Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.

JERRY
Oh, then I'm not worried.
Lloyd Braun enters in the background.

KRAMER
But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him
like he's one of the gang, huh.
Lloyd wanders toward the guys at the table.

GEORGE
(thoughtful) Breakdown, huh?

LLOYD
Hey Kramer.

KRAMER
Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)

LLOYD
How you doing?

KRAMER
(slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)

LLOYD
Hi Jerry.

JERRY
Lloyd.

LLOYD
George.
Lloyd sits beside George.

GEORGE
Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?

KRAMER
Yeah well, he's doing fine, George.

LLOYD
(offering packet) Gum?

JERRY
(peering) That's an interesting package.

LLOYD
Yeah, it's from China. Go ahead, try a piece. Tell me that's not the most
delicious gum you've ever tasted.

KRAMER
Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he
takes pieces for himself and Jerry)

LLOYD
George?

GEORGE
I don't chew gum.

JERRY
(chewing) Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?

LLOYD
Friend of mine in Chinatown gave it to me. If you want I can ask him
where he got it.

JERRY
Nah, don't bother.

LLOYD
No, it's no problem.

JERRY
I don't want it.

KRAMER
Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the
gum.

JERRY
Alright.

KRAMER
Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm.
[Jerry's Apartment]
George sits at the table examining the contents of his wallet. Jerry is still
chewing, and by his face, he's not enjoying it.

GEORGE
You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change.
Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.
Elaine enters.

ELAINE
Hey.

GEORGE
Hey.

JERRY
I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a
little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin)

ELAINE
What kind is that?

JERRY
It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.

ELAINE
Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?

GEORGE
(almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete
nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.

ELAINE
You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you
don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?

JERRY
You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently
for months.

ELAINE
Yeah? Well, I got news for you.

GEORGE
The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother
was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'

JERRY
And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
George snaps his fingers and points to Jerry, signaling his agreement. Then he
picks up his jacket and heads for the door.

GEORGE
Right, gotta get going.

JERRY
Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?

GEORGE
Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.

JERRY
I thought your parents were outta town?

GEORGE
Why d'you think I'm going now?

[STREET
Queens]
George has parked his car on the street, and gets out. An elderly guy is on the
porch of his house and recognises George.

POP
Georgie!

GEORGE
Hey, Mr Lazzari.

POP
Back in the old neighborhood, ah?

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.

POP
Oh, snazzy car. Le Baron?

GEORGE
Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.

POP
The actor, right?

GEORGE
Something like that.

POP
Mind if I look under the hood?

GEORGE
Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.
A young woman has exited from the old guy's house, and approaches.

POP
Oh, Deena! Deena, Deena, l... look who's here.
Pop lifts the hood of the car, and leans into the engine compartment.

DEENA
George Costanza, is that you?

GEORGE
Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as
pretty as you did back in high school.

DEENA
Boy, those were some crazy times.

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?

[ALEX THEATRE
Lobby]
Kramer is leading Jerry and Elaine on a tour of the Alex. There are a few
customers scattered about and a bored attendant behind the counter. Elaine has a
big bucket of popcorn.

KRAMER
The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of
movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two,
fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.

ELAINE
Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?

KRAMER
Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark
status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.

JERRY
Oh, can Lloyd really do that?

KRAMER
Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to
Elaine) And you should say hello to him, Elaine.

ELAINE
(concerned) What? Lloyd is here?
Kramer indicates Lloyd approaching.

ELAINE
What? No, no, I'd rather...

LLOYD
Hi Elaine.

ELAINE
(big fake smile) Lloyd, yes. Hello.

LLOYD
Kramer tell you? We reserved some special seats, so we can all sit
together.

ELAINE
(reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit
in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he,
he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you
afterwards.
Elaine grabs Jerry by the arm and leads him toward the auditorium.

LLOYD
That was odd. Am I crazy, or does Jerry not wear glasses?

KRAMER
(emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot
'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy.

[ALEX THEATRE
Auditorium]
Jerry and Elaine sit in the front row of seats. Elaine is eating popcorn.

JERRY
We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special
seats?

ELAINE
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again.
Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
The lights go down, and music is heard as the show begins. Jerry and Elaine lean
back in their seats to be able to see the screen

JERRY
Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.

[STREET
Queens]
Deena and George are still talking. Pop is under the hood of George's car. Bangs
and clanks can be heard as he fiddles with the mechanics.

DEENA
Poor Lloyd.

GEORGE
I know. Completely bonkers!

DEENA
Sorry I can't be so flip about this kind of thing. You know, after what
happened to Pop.

GEORGE
Pop? What happened to Pop?

DEENA
I thought you heard. He had a nervous breakdown last year. That's why I'm
taking care of him.
Pop comes out momentarily.

POP
Oh, I tell you, they don't build 'em like this any more.
He goes back under the hood.

GEORGE
(a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?

DEENA
Uhn, it was too much for him.
Pop is thumping away at part of the engine with a spanner.

GEORGE
(very worried) Uhm, I, I gotta go.

DEENA
What?

GEORGE
I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop.
Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.

[ALEX THEATRE
Auditorium]
Kramer and Lloyd sits side by side in the special seats, watching Spartacus.
They're smiling happily.
Jerry and Elaine lean uncomfortably back in their front-row seats. They're both
eating popcorn. Elaine drops a piece onto her blouse, where it rests next to a
fancy button. She retrieves the corn, and dislodges the button without noticing.
The button falls to the floor where it rests among other detritus.
[George's Car]
George is driving along the road in his Le Baron. Over the usual engine noise
can be heard a metallic rasping, grinding noise. George listens for a few
moments, wondering where it's coming from. Then he looks concerned, then angry.

GEORGE
Pop! POP!!

[ALEX THEATRE
Lobby]
Kramer and Jerry stand in the lobby. Kramer smoking his pipe, Jerry massaging
his neck. Lloyd wanders over to join them.

LLOYD
's a great movie, huh?

KRAMER
Yeah.

LLOYD
Sorry you forgot those glasses.

JERRY
I don't know what I was thinking.

LLOYD
How'd you like that gum?

JERRY
(noncommittal) Errh.

KRAMER
(slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.
Elaine enters. In the absence of the button she lost in the auditorium, her
blouse is open to below her breasts, and everything's in the shop window. Not
that she knows it.

ELAINE
Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the
ladies' room.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired.
Elaine is suffering with her neck. She rolls her head back and feels the back of
her neck with her hand.

ELAINE
Oh. Oh God.

LLOYD
You alright?
Elaine stretches her back and neck, at the same time pushing her upperworks into
greater prominence.

ELAINE
Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot
bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.
Elaine leaves. Kramer and Lloyd both stare after her.
[Street Outside Alex]
Elaine walks down the sidewalk, her blouse still open. A florist is using a hose
to wash down the sidewalk in front of his store. Elaine carefully steps by,
picking her way past. The florist also stares at Elaine's exposure.
A cop stands a little further down the street. Elaine approaches him.

ELAINE
Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a
hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he
just use a broom?
The cop stares at Elaine's breasts the whole time she's talking.

COP
Lady, you sold me. (strides toward florist) Hey, you with the hose.
Elaine looks confused about his attitude. She glances down, and notices her
blouse wide open. She quickly pulls her coat closed, to hide her embarrassment,
and hurries away.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Kramer is handing Jerry a pair of spectacles.

KRAMER
Yeah, put these glasses on.

JERRY
(taking them) Well, what's this for?

KRAMER
Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.

JERRY
So what?

KRAMER
Well, he thinks you wear those.
Jerry looks at the glasses with some distaste.

KRAMER
They're from the lost and found at the Alex.

JERRY
Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.

KRAMER
Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on
purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.
[Monk's]
George leans on the counter by the cash register, behind which sits Ruthie
Cohen.

GEORGE
'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you
with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten.

CASHIER
I don't think so.

GEORGE
Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill
and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles)
that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?

CASHIER
Not unless you buy something.

GEORGE
Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.
Lloyd approaches the register to pay for something. The cashier rings up
George's purchase.

LLOYD
Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?

GEORGE
I don't.
Ruthie opens the drawer on the register.

CASHIER
Take a look.
George goes round to the other side of the register and picks up all the
twenty-dollar bills. He shuffles through them, examining them for doodles.

GEORGE
I know I gave it to you.

LLOYD
George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry.
In addition to Lloyd, another customer is waiting to pay.

GEORGE
(frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door)
Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't
forget that easily!
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is reading a newspaper, and holding it in such a way as to conceal his
face.

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry, look who's here.
Jerry folds over the top half of the paper, in order to see his visitor. He also
reveals to all that he is wearing the spectacles Kramer gave him earlier.

JERRY
Ah, Lloyd.

LLOYD
Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.
He proffers the packet to Jerry.

JERRY
(unenthusiastic) Oh, the gum.

KRAMER
Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?

JERRY
(still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)

KRAMER
Oh, boy.
Kramer and Lloyd sit on the couch. All of them start chewing on the gum.

KRAMER
Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting
around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he
can get more of this.
Jerry makes a show of removing his glasses and cleaning them.

JERRY
Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish
anything he sets his mind to.
Jerry puts his glasses back on.

LLOYD
Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you to him,
you can get it whenever you want.

JERRY
's not necessary.

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.

JERRY
I know that, Kramer.

LLOYD
Well, if you don't want to...

KRAMER
No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he
appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?

JERRY
Yes I do, Kramer.

LLOYD
So...

KRAMER
Yeah?

LLOYD
How about that Elaine today, huh?

KRAMER
Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?

LLOYD
(to Jerry) She was practically undressing in front of me at the theatre.

JERRY
I didn't see anything.

KRAMER
Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom,
ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.
They continue to chew on the gum. Lloyd seemingly happily, Jerry clearly not
liking it, and Kramer not liking it, but unwilling to show it to Lloyd.
[Park]
George and Deena sit on a bench.

DEENA
You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again.
George clearly thinks he's clicked.

GEORGE
Well, you know. (grins, snorts) It's understandable.
He pats Deena on the knee.

DEENA
I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown I uh,
become very sensitive to the warning signs.

GEORGE
Warning signs?

DEENA
Nervousness, irritability, paranoia.

GEORGE
(disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the
one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.

DEENA
Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others.

GEORGE
All my friends do that.

DEENA
George, I'm only trying to help...
George is staring past Deena at something a short distance away.

DEENA
I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?

GEORGE
You see that woman on the horse? (points)
Ruthie Cohen is passing by on horseback.

GEORGE
She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've
gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!

DEENA
So again it all comes back to Lloyd.

GEORGE
(rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back
here!! Don't gallop away!!
George runs away, yelling after the retreating Ruthie Cohen.
[Monk's]
Jerry and George sit in a booth. There's a different cashier on duty.

JERRY
So you say she was on a horse?

GEORGE
I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.

JERRY
Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if
any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big
lips.
Elaine enters.

ELAINE
Hey.

JERRY
Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.

ELAINE
(sits beside Jerry) What?

JERRY
I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the
peepshow you gave him at the Alex.

ELAINE
(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open.
I musta left it at the theatre.

JERRY
Maybe it's in the lost and found.

ELAINE
Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too,
you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.

JERRY
You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.

[ALEX THEATRE
Lobby]
Kramer greets a small elderly gent.

KRAMER
Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at
the Alex Theatre.

HAARWOOD
Well I, I'm in a bit of a quandary. I've misplaced my spectacles.

KRAMER
Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?
Kramer ducks behind the counter to retrieve the lost and found box.

HAARWOOD
They're half-glasses.
Kramer pops his head up, a thought having occurred.

KRAMER
Brown?

HAARWOOD
Mmm, yes, yes.
Kramer places the cardboard box marked 'Lost and Found' on the counter.

KRAMER
Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up
soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some
paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.

HAARWOOD
Certainly.
Kramer leaves. Haarwood begins to rummage through the contents of the box. After
a few seconds, he finds something. He lifts it out for a closer look. It's the
button Elaine dropped earlier.

HAARWOOD
Oh my goodness. What a spanking button.

[GEORGE'S CAR
Street Outside Alex]
George starts his car. It's still making unhealthy noises.
As he sits with the engine running, a car pulls up in the street behind him. The
driver sounds the horn at George as he sits in his parking spot.

GEORGE
(glances in mirror) Alright. Alright.
The horn sounds again.

GEORGE
(getting annoyed) Hang on, it's warming up!
The horn sounds several more times, impatiently. George has had enough. He
climbs out of his car.

GEORGE
(angrily) Oh you mother...
George stalks round his car and up to the driver's window of the car sounding
its horn.

GEORGE
Hey! What is your problem?
The driver rolls down the window, and we see Ruthie Cohen.

GEORGE
Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that
meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug)
Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?

CASHIER
Your car's on fire.
The reflection of leaping flames can be seen in Ruthie's window. George dashes
off back to his car.

GEORGE
Aah! Fire!

CASHIER
(after George) Merry Christmas!
Flames are coming from under the hood of the Le Baron.

GEORGE
(shouting) Fire!!
The florist is standing holding a broom. George rushes to him.

GEORGE
Your hose! Where's your hose?!

FLORIST
Cop made me disconnect it.
George grabs the broom from the florist, and begins beating at the flames with
no effect. After a few seconds, the broom is alight.
[Street Outside Alex]
The whole front of George's car is burnt out. The plastic body parts have melted
away. The hood is wide open, showing the devastation within. George stands,
holding the charred remnants of the broom. He's staring catatonically at the
damage. Kramer walks up and does a double-take at the sight.

KRAMER
Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?

GEORGE
The Jon Voight car is no more.

KRAMER
Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.

GEORGE
No kidding?

KRAMER
No kidding.

GEORGE
Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.

KRAMER
Yeah, merry Christmas.
Kramer walks on.

GEORGE
(staring at the wreck) Whatever.

[ALEX THEATRE
Lobby]
Jerry is waiting. He's wearing the glasses from earlier.

JERRY
Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?

KRAMER
What, he's not here yet?

JERRY
Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!

KRAMER
Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses.
Kramer reaches across and plucks the glasses from Jerry's face.

JERRY
Why?

KRAMER
They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.
Kramer rummages in lost and found, and brings out another pair of spectacles.

KRAMER
(proffering) Here, try this pair.
Jerry puts them on. The lenses are much stronger than the first pair - they're
like bottle-bottoms. He stares through them, his eyes magnified hugely. It's
obvious he can't see at all clearly.

JERRY
Aw, these are really strong glasses.
He takes a step and almost trips over the counter.

LLOYD
Hey gum-buddy. Nice frames. You ready to go?

JERRY
(lacking enthusiasm) Yeah, yeah.

KRAMER
(clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.

LLOYD
Anybody see Elaine today?

KRAMER
Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out
lost and found.

LLOYD
Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not wearing,
if you know what I mean.
They chuckle.

JERRY
Absolutely. Let's just stick around.

LLOYD
Ah, tell you what, they're expecting us though. Lemme just grab a hotdog
here.

KRAMER
Uh, yeah.
Lloyd goes to the counter, and speaks to the attendant.

LLOYD
I'd like a hotdog, please.
The attendant looks to the machine, which contains one hotdog. The appearance of
the article is not pleasant. It's wrinkled, shriveled, and generally
disgusting.

ATTENDANT
Are you outta your mind?
Hearing this, Kramer dashes over.

KRAMER
Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?

ATTENDANT
This hotdog's been here since the silent era. You'd have to be insane
to eat it.

KRAMER
No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong
with it or you.

LLOYD
Kramer, maybe...

KRAMER
No, no, no, no. I'll show you. (slams a bill down on the counter) One
hotdog please.

ATTENDANT
(on your head be it) Okay.

KRAMER
Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?
The attendant hands over the hotdog.

KRAMER
Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's delicious.
Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite)
As he chews, it begins to be apparent that all is not as it should be with the
hotdog.

KRAMER
Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches) I
gotta get, some air.
Kramer stumbles toward the exit, bits of half-chewed hotdog falling from his
mouth.
[Street Outside Alex]
Kramer walks stiffly along the sidewalk. He's breathing heavily, and loosening
his collar. He walks by the florist, who is brushing the sidewalk again. As
Kramer passes George's car, his struggle with the rancid hotdog ends with the
hotdog triumphant, and he leans into the gutter behind the Le Baron and vomits
copiously. The florist looks rueful, leans his broom against his door, and
fetches his hose, whilst Kramer continues his refunding.

[STREET OUTSIDE ALEX
Later]
The florist is hosing away the traces of Kramer's visit. Elaine walks up to him.

ELAINE
Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?

FLORIST
How would you happen to know that?

ELAINE
Well, uhm... I...

FLORIST
(accusing) You're that lady that was talking to the cops, aren't you?

ELAINE
Uh... I...
A voice calls from across the street.

VOICE (O.C.)
Hey, Joe!
The florist turns to see who's shouting. As he does, he raises the nozzle of his
hose, so instead of hosing the sidewalk, he sprays Elaine.

ELAINE
No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!
The florist notices what he's done and turns off the hose.

[ALEX THEATRE
Lobby]
Jerry sits beside Kramer, who still looks unwell. Lloyd stands comforting
Kramer. Elaine enters. She has removed her jacket, and is wearing a wringing wet
t-shirt.

ELAINE
Hey. Hey everybody.

LLOYD
Whoah, Elaine! Once again, you've managed to top yourself. C'mon Jerry,
let's go. Car's out front.
Lloyd leaves. Jerry stands and peers about himself through the over-strength
glasses. All he can make out are vague blurred shapes.

JERRY
Lloyd?
He moves across the lobby, slowly, holding his hands out to feel for obstacles.

JERRY
Lloyd?
Jerry leaves.

ELAINE
(exasperated) What is Lloyd's problem?

KRAMER
Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this
is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.

ELAINE
Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your
swing joints.
Elaine casts her eyes heavenward.
[Street Outside Alex]
The remains of George's car are being towed away. On the opposite side of the
road, watching, are Deena and George.

DEENA
So, you want my father to pay for this?

GEORGE
You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did
there.

DEENA
And I suppose Lloyd Braun had something to do with it too.

GEORGE
No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier.

DEENA
What cashier?

GEORGE
You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.

DEENA
To park her horse?

GEORGE
No, she wasn't on the horse.

DEENA
So, your car caught fire because of my father and the woman on the horse?

GEORGE
That's right.
Across the street, the florist is outside his store, arranging flowers.

GEORGE
(points) And him!

DEENA
The man with the flowers?

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little
crazy, but...
A car pulls up beside George and Deena. George looks in the window.

GEORGE
I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.

DEENA
Who?

GEORGE
Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to
Jerry) Jerry.
Jerry hears his name called and turns his head, but all he can see are blurry
colored shapes.

GEORGE
Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!
The car pulls away, leaving George calling after it.

GEORGE
Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're...

DEENA
(doubtful) That was your best friend?

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.

DEENA
That man was wearing glasses.

GEORGE
I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!
[Lloyd Braun's Car]
Jerry and Lloyd have reached Chinatown. Lloyd parks the car.

LLOYD
I'll run in and get the gum.

JERRY
Alright.

LLOYD
Got any money?
Jerry digs his wallet out of his pocket. He opens it and extracts a bill. He
peers at it, trying to work out what denomination it is, but the glasses are
still too strong.

JERRY
(handing it over) Here.
Lloyd takes the bill, looks at it, smiles a little with surprise.

LLOYD
(climbing out of the car) I'll be back.
[Street]
George and Deena walk along together.

GEORGE
Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a
series of bad coincidences.

DEENA
I don't know, George. I don't know what to believe.

GEORGE
Believe me, I am not crazy.

DEENA
Well, I guess it's possible.
[Lloyd Braun's Car]
Jerry sits waiting. Lloyd gets in. He has a stack of six boxes, which he hands
to Jerry.

LLOYD
Here y'go.

JERRY
(indistinct) Got all this?

LLOYD
Yeah. A hundred dollar's worth.

JERRY
(incredulous) I gave you a hundred dollars?!

LLOYD
You sure did. Am I crazy, or is that a lotta gum?

JERRY
It's a lotta gum!
[The Institute]
The room is festooned with props and costumes from old movies.

KRAMER
Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses.

HAARWOOD
Oh, splendid. Welcome to the Institute for the Preservation of Motion
Picture Costumes and Wardrobe.

KRAMER
Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W.

HAARWOOD
Well eh, we prefer to call it the Institute.
Kramer notices a particular costume.

KRAMER
Is that from Henry the Eighth?

HAARWOOD
Yes, yes, it is.

KRAMER
Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think
that I could wear that to promote the theatre?

HAARWOOD
Well, I... I'd love to lend it to you, but I doubt if it would fit a
man of your impressive, Raymond Massey-like, physique. The only person who could
really fit into this costume, would have to be a short, stocky, man of somewhat
generous proportions.

KRAMER
(an idea occurs) You don't say.
[Street]
Kramer and George walk together. George is wearing the Henry VIII costume -
doublet and hose, cloak, crown, etc.

KRAMER
You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so
thrilled.

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.

KRAMER
Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.

GEORGE
(angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute,
wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.
He gets his wallet from under the cape, and goes to the window of a kiosk.

GEORGE
(handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?

GUY
I beg your pardon, your majesty, but we don't accept bills with lipstick on
the president.

GEORGE
What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess
I owe that cashier an apology.
Deena is walking toward George and Kramer. She sees George in his costume and
jumps to the obvious conclusion.

DEENA
Oh my God!

GEORGE
No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.
Deena turns and begins to walk away.

GEORGE
Th... this isn't mine.
George begins to walk after Deena, who accelerates to a trot.

GEORGE
I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
Deena breaks into a run, with George chasing her.

GEORGE
(shouting) Dee... Deena!

[ALEX THEATRE
Lobby]
Kramer stands behind the counter, upon which Elaine leans. Mr Haarwood enters.

KRAMER
Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.

HAARWOOD
Well, thank you. Uh, where is your friend King Henry?

KRAMER
Oh, he ran away.
Lloyd enters.

LLOYD
Hey Kramer.

KRAMER
I need to talk to you.
Lloyd and Kramer go away to the side of the lobby, where they go into a quiet
conversation. Elaine is peering over at Mr Haarwood, and in particular at the
button he's wearing on his cravat.

ELAINE
You know, that button looks very familiar.

HAARWOOD
Yes, it, it, it's antique ivory.

ELAINE
I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've
been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?

HAARWOOD
Yes, it was in the lost and found.

ELAINE
Shall I undo it?

HAARWOOD
Oh yes, of course you can.

ELAINE
Oh, thank you.
Elaine moves very close to Mr Haarwood, and reaches under his chin to remove the
button.

HAARWOOD
I'm a little ticklish.

ELAINE
Oh. (giggly) Tickle, tickle.
Kramer and Lloyd are both staring over at the sight of Elaine tickling Mr
Haarwood under the chin, giggling, apparently flirting.

LLOYD
We've really gotta get the Elaine a boyfriend.

KRAMER
Oh, tell me about it.
End.

ELAINE
[thinking] I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so
cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh,
Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your
personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit
your job and never work again.
[club applauds]

ELAINE
Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.

JERRY
Maybe he'll write a song about you.

ELAINE
Yeah. Right. [laughing] Like that really matters.

JERRY
So I take it he's spongeworthy?

ELAINE
Oh, yeah.

JERRY
Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know,
uninhibited and free.

ELAINE
Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.

JERRY
Oh, no?

ELAINE
Yeah. In fact, he....[moaning]

JERRY
Come on. Come on.

ELAINE
I don't wanna!

JERRY
Elaine, you're among friends.

ELAINE
[sighs] Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do...
everything.

JERRY
Oh.

ELAINE
Yeah. It's surprising.

JERRY
Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?

ELAINE
No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna
lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.

JERRY
Sure. Why not? You're there.

ELAINE
Exactly.

JERRY
But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship.
Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.

KRAMER
Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my
stuff outta the car.

JERRY
What stuff?

KRAMER
I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.

JERRY
All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you
buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.

KRAMER
Course I will. These are staples.

JERRY
A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?

KRAMER
Lindsay olives, Jerry.

JERRY
A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten
pounds of cocktail meatballs?

KRAMER
$17.50. You can't beat that.

JERRY
Look...look at this can of tuna!

KRAMER
Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.

JERRY
This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.

KRAMER
Hey, Clyde!

CLYDE
Hey, Kramer! What's happening, dude?

KRAMER
Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here.

CLYDE
How ya doin'?

JERRY
Hi.

KRAMER
You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.

JERRY
John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs
with Elaine.

CLYDE
Oh yeah?

JERRY
Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot
and heavy.

CLYDE
Is that right?

KRAMER
Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff
upstairs.

CLYDE
Oh, sorry Kramer, I got to watch the hands. My hands are my life.

ESTELLE
Georgie, can you zip me up?

GEORGE
Yeah. Yeah, one second.

ESTELLE
Well, come on!

GEORGE
All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make
a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this
night.

ESTELLE
Well, I'm meeting your in-laws, I think I should look nice.

GEORGE
My in-laws. Oh, my....

FRANK
So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good when he wants
to, huh?

ESTELLE
I don't like that tie.

FRANK
What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.

ESTELLE
It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.

FRANK
How do you know what kind of ties they wear?

ESTELLE
Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if there's
anyone there wearing a thin tie like that. Go ahead!

FRANK
Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue.

ESTELLE
George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?

FRANK
Huh?

GEORGE
I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.

FRANK
We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.

ESTELLE
It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at Lord's?
It's right over here.

FRANK
No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people something
about taste!

GEORGE
This is gonna be fun.

JERRY
Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in
your friend John Germaine's band there.

ELAINE
So what did he have to say?

JERRY
Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.

ELAINE
Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?

JERRY
Yeah.

ELAINE
What did you do that for?

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that
we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and
heavy if he's not hot and heavy.

JERRY
Oh

ELAINE
I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't
wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.

JERRY
Well, Clyde might not tell him.

ELAINE
How do you know that?

JERRY
I should have helped Kramer with those packages.

ELAINE
Ohh!
[Kramer, walking down hall to his apartment, his arms loaded with dozens of
pop cans, falls forward, spilling cans about in hallway]

DENNIS
Let me give you a hand. Hey, Kramer. I wonder, could you do me a
favor? I'm taking the family to Disneyworld next week. I wonder...

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

DENNIS
I wonder, could you pick up my mail?

KRAMER
Yeah. Sure. Sure.

DENNIS
In fact, you know what, how would you like to take my hansom cab for
the week?

KRAMER
Drive the horse?

DENNIS
It'll just be sitting there. You can really clean up. 500 bucks a
day. I'll split it with ya.

KRAMER
Oh, giddyup. Yeah.

GEORGE
This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.

MRS. ROSS
Oh.

MR. ROSS
What are you complimenting her for? She didn't make it Rowenna did.

FRANK
What is this thing anyway?

MRS. ROSS
It's Cornish gamehen.

FRANK
What is that, like a little chicken?

GEORGE
It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. [laughing] Little chicken. It's
a gamebird.

FRANK
Gamebird?

GEORGE
Yeah.

FRANK
What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?

MR. ROSS
Yes.

FRANK
How hard could it be to kill this thing?

ESTELLE
I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library in there.

MRS. ROSS
If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, [laughing] I'd
be broke.

SUSAN
More wine anyone?

FRANK
Yeah. I'll take some.

SUSAN
Hmmm?

FRANK
Thank you.

SUSAN
How do you like the Merlot?

ESTELLE
Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?

MRS. ROSS
Oh, mother.

GEORGE
She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot.

FRANK
Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The
rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?

GEORGE
Why don't we talk about it another time.

FRANK
But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster and a
chicken. Something's missing!

MRS. ROSS
Something's missing all right.

MR. ROSS
They're all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them.

FRANK
That's perverse.

GEORGE
Did anybody see Firestorm?

MR. ROSS
Firestorm, that's a hell of a picture.

GEORGE
Yeah.

MR. ROSS
Remember when they had the helicopter land on top of that car --

FRANK
Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.

MR. ROSS
It doesn't have anything to do with the plot!

FRANK
Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!

GEORGE
Oh mother of God.
[clip clop]

KRAMER
Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by
Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies
could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On
Rusty!
[applause]

JOHN
Thank you. Now, I'd like to play something th -- well, actually, it's
my latest so it's nice and fresh. It's called " Hot And Heavy."
[saxophone playing]

GEORGE
Thank God that's over.

ESTELLE
The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't like that.

FRANK
And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? Would it
kill them to put out a pound cake? Something!

GEORGE
So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.

ESTELLE
It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after a meal. I'm
sorry. It's impolite.

FRANK
Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta be stupid to
do something like that!

ESTELLE
Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like idiots
drinking coffee without a piece of cake!

GEORGE
What is this? The marble rye?

MRS. ROSS
Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they brought.

ESTELLE
We forgot to bring it in.

FRANK
No, I brought it in. They never put it out.

MRS. ROSS
Where is it?

SUSAN
I don't know. Where'd you put it?

MRS. ROSS
Right over there.

SUSAN
Well, it's gone.

GEORGE
You stole the bread?

FRANK
What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. Why should
I leave it there?

GEORGE
Because we brought it for them!

FRANK
Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve.

MRS. ROSS
Is it possible they took it back?

SUSAN
Who would bring a bread and take it back?

MR. ROSS
Those people, that's who. I think they're sick.

ESTELLE
People take buses to get that rye.

GEORGE
Maybe they forgot to put it out!

FRANK
Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, I
tell ya!

JERRY
He stole back the rye?

GEORGE
Yeah.

JERRY
Why?

GEORGE
Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.

JERRY
So, do the Ross's know?

GEORGE
I don't know. They're all very suspicious.

JERRY
Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.

GEORGE
Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all
separated for the rest of my life.

JERRY
Bad situation.

GEORGE
I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.

JERRY
What do you mean replace it?

GEORGE
You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have
to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen
somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.

JERRY
Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?

GEORGE
What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I
can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the
apartment!

JERRY
All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the
Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait
a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom
cab.

GEORGE
So?

JERRY
Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.

GEORGE
And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a
hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?

JERRY
Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop,
clip clop. They're nuts for it.

GEORGE
So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is
there.

JERRY
What about Susan?

GEORGE
She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner
with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven
o'clock.

JERRY
Beautiful!

GEORGE
You think Kramer'll do it?

KRAMER
Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there
at seven?

GEORGE
Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.

KRAMER
Hey.

JERRY
What the hell are you doing there?

KRAMER
It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?

JERRY
No. No thanks.

KRAMER
Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any
room for it all.

GEORGE
Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread
into the apartment?

JERRY
Just put it under your shirt.

GEORGE
Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!

JERRY
I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll
come by five after seven right after they leave.

GEORGE
Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! [laughing]

ELAINE
Hey. Is that your horse outside?

KRAMER
Yeah. That's Rusty.

GEORGE
What? He's outside?

KRAMER
Uh-huh.

GEORGE
Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.

KRAMER
You wanna go see him?

GEORGE
Yeah. Hey! Hey!

KRAMER
I'll show ya Rusty.

GEORGE
Hey, Lainey, wanna see the horsey?

ELAINE
Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in
a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just
great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then
you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.

JERRY
So, you think Clyde told him?

ELAINE
He wrote a song about it!

JERRY
Well, maybe it's a good thing.

ELAINE
No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is
like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick
to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?

JERRY
No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very
pleasant.

ELAINE
You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you.
It has to!

JERRY
No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're
seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.

ELAINE
I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late
show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset
him.

MR. ROSS
Yeah George, I gotta tell ya, this is a very nice gesture. We
really appreciate it.

GEORGE
Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I
can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha
ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?

MR. ROSS
Oh, we got about twenty minutes. You, uh, seem a little nervous
George. Anything wrong?

GEORGE
Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine.
Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh,
could I get a glass of water?

MRS. ROSS
We've got water. I don't think we have any bread, but we've got
water.

KRAMER
Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno.
[singing] I'm so keen-o
On Beef-A-Reeno
What a delicious cuisine-o
Fit for a king and queen-o!
Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans.

MR. ROSS
Nice night for a hansom cab ride, 'ay George?

MRS. ROSS
You know, George we haven't done anything romantic like this in
....years.

GEORGE
[thinking] Oh my God, it's 7:01. What have I done? My whole plan is
depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a
stupid mistake? He'll never show up!
[clip clop]

KRAMER
Ah ha!

GEORGE
There he is. Right on time as usual.

COUNTER WOMAN
53.

MABEL
53. I'd like a marble rye, no plastic, in a bag.

COUNTER WOMAN
Ah! You're lucky. It's our last one.

JERRY
Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?

COUNTER WOMAN
That's right.

JERRY
There's none left?

COUNTER WOMAN
That's what I said. Number 54.

JERRY
Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have
that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may
depend on it.

MABEL
Well, I'm sorry, but you should have got here earlier.

JERRY
Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to
give it up.

MABEL
You're not getting this rye --

JERRY
All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you
double what you paid for it.

MABEL
You're in my way!

KRAMER
Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for
this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot
chocolate if the mood should strike you.

MRS. ROSS
My favorite.

KRAMER
Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me
show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh,
happy anniversary. On, Rusty!
[clip clop]

JERRY
All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be
reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye.

MABEL
No? Watch me.

JERRY
Give me that rye!

MABEL
Stop it!

JERRY
I want that rye, lady!

MABEL
Help! Someone help!

JERRY
Shut up, you old bag!

MABEL
Stop thief! Stop him! He's got my marble rye!

ELAINE
I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got
your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I
know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you
that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and
heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?

JOHN
Whoa. Hold on, Elaine I.....I'm kinda disappointed.

ELAINE
Disappointed?

JOHN
Yeah. I mean, I was excited when Clyde told me that.

ELAINE
You were?

JOHN
Absolutely.

ELAINE
Ohh! Whew! I am so relieved!

JOHN
Listen, uh, I've still got a couple of hours to kill before the next
show. My place is only a few blocks from here.

ELAINE
Really?

JOHN
And you know what?

ELAINE
What?

JOHN
I've been thinking about what we do and I'm thinking..of...adding a new
number to my, you know, repertoire.

ELAINE
Ohh!
[clip clop]
[Rusty snorting]

KRAMER
Y'aah!
[clip clop]
[Rusty farts]

MRS. ROSS
[sniffing] What is that?

MR. ROSS
I think it's the horse.

MRS. ROSS
Oh, God.

KRAMER
Hey, how's everything? You..you need anything?

MRS. ROSS
This is - this is...horrible.

MR. ROSS
Excuse me,...what do you feed this animal?

KRAMER
Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff.

MRS. ROSS
I can't take this. Let me out of this thing!

MR. ROSS
Turn this thing around. We've had it. We can't breathe back here!
And hurry it up!

KRAMER
Rusty! Rusty!

GEORGE
[whistling]
[clip clopping beginning in distance and growing discernibly louder]

KRAMER
Whoa!

GEORGE
Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?

MR. ROSS
Ask Rusty.

KRAMER
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the
gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function.

MRS. ROSS
Thanks for nothing! Come on, George. Let's go upstairs.

GEORGE
What the hell happened?

KRAMER
The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.

GEORGE
Beef-A-Reeno? You fed the horse Beef-A-Reeno?!

KRAMER
Well, I overbought!

MR. ROSS
George.

GEORGE
[muttering]

MUSIC GUY
What's going on? Where is he?

MANAGER
Uh...he'll be here soon.

MUSIC GUY
I'll give him ten more minutes. I'm not gonna stay here all night.

JERRY
How much did you give him?

KRAMER
Just a can. But he really liked it, though.

GEORGE
Jerry! Up here!

JERRY
Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?

GEORGE
I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!

JERRY
Really?

GEORGE
Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?

JERRY
Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any
oxygen.

KRAMER
I don't wanna go back on there!

GEORGE
Come on!

JERRY
[grunting as he throws bread into the air]

GEORGE
[grunting] Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea.

ELAINE
No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have
to try so hard. Good luck, honey.

GEORGE
Come on! Come on!

JERRY
Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is
too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.
[George finally gets rye into apartment, turning around to discover everyone
staring at him]

GEORGE
Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. [grunting]

MANAGER
Ladies and gentlemen, John Germaine.
[applause]
[John attempts to play saxophone, discovering that no sound is being created
by the instrument]
End.

(SCENE
Jerry's Apartment)

JERRY
So why don't you get a locksmith?

GEORGE
I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has
this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the
membership to kick in.

JERRY
How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?

GEORGE
I don't know, about three days.
(Kramer enters with golf clubs)

JERRY
Y- you're not playin' golf?

KRAMER
Yes, indeed. The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring
are out.

GEORGE
Are the courses open?

KRAMER
No, no........I'm sneaking in with Stan the Caddy, we've been
going through the caddies entrance.
George. Huh, No kidding?

KRAMER
Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has
transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll
have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. Oh, that's my dream,
Jerry.

JERRY
Really, you're getting that good?

KRAMER
Oh, I'm the real deal.
(Knocking is heard from outside in the hallway)

KRAMER
Yeah, here, Stan, in here!
(Stan enters)

KRAMER
There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, this is Stan the Caddy.

GEORGE
How ya doin'?

JERRY
Hi.

STAN
Nice to meet you. Ready to hit the links, Kramer?

KRAMER
Oh yeah, you betcha.

STAN
What are those, ah, cotton pants?

KRAMER
Yeah...Why, is it too cold out?

STAN
Here's what you do: you bring a lightweight jacket, that way the
sun comes out, you play the jacket off the sweater.

KRAMER
Ah, that makes sense, that's a good call, Stan. Alright, we'll
see you guys later, huh?

GEORGE
Yeah.

JERRY
Yeah, we'll see ya.
(Kramer and Stan leave)

JERRY AND GEORGE (TOGETHER)

On the street)

SUE ELLEN
Elaine?
(Elaine turns to see Sue Ellen waving her hand)

SUE ELLEN
Hi!

ELAINE (THINKING TO HERSELF)
Oh, great. It's the bra-less wonder. Who
does she think she's kidding? Look at her, she's totally out of
control. 

SUE ELLEN
I was thinking that woman looks like Elaine Benes. 

ELAINE
Yeah, ha ha ha. What have you been up to?

SUE ELLEN
I've just been hanging out.

ELAINE (NODDING)
I see.

SUE ELLEN
Oh, listen! I'm having a birthday party tomorrow evening,
I'd love it if you came by.

ELAINE
Tomorrow...? I don't know if I can.

SUE ELLEN
Nooo?

ELAINE
Yeah, I'm just really, really busy.

SUE ELLEN
Oh, that's too bad.

ELAINE
Yeah.

SUE ELLEN
Well, I hope you can get me a gift anyway.........ha ha ha.

ELAINE
Ha ha ha.

(SCENE
Yankee Stadium)

WILHELM
George!?

GEORGE
Mr. Wilhelm!

WILHELM
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Mr Steinbrenner and I really
want you to know we appreciate all the hours you've been putting
in....And, ah, confidentially, Sozonkel, our Assistant to the General
Manger, hasn't really been working out. And the boos thinks, you're the
man for the job! So, keep it under your hat!

(SCENE
Jerry's Apartment)

GEORGE
Assistant to the General Manager!! You know what means?!?
He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm a
heartbeat away!

JERRY
That's a hell of an organization they're running up there. I
can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.

GEORGE
And, it is all because of that car. You see, Steinbrenner is
like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, he figures
I'm the first guy in. Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He
see my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of
them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day!

JERRY
Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever
made.
(Elaine enters)

ELAINE
Hey.

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
Hey, how ya doing?!?

ELAINE
Better, now.

JERRY
yeah, what happened?

ELAINE
You know Sue Ellen Mishke?

JERRY
Sue Ellen Mishke? 

ELAINE
Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last
year...

JERRY
Sounds familiar.

ELAINE
The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--

JERRY
Oh, yeah, you mentioned her.

ELAINE
Yes. I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once,
ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.

GEORGE
Ah, that is disgusting--

JERRY
That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--

GEORGE
The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--

JERRY
It's wrong, it's rude, and it's--

GEORGE
It's disgusting--

ELAINE (GETTING UP TO LEAVE)
Alright, there's no---

GEORGE
Come on! Come-on.

JERRY
We're only kidding!

ELAINE
You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She
stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. I was at this party, and
I was dating this really cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way,
and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows
her, right out the door!

JERRY (EXCITED)
She's your Lex Luthor!

ELAINE
Her birthday's comin' up, so I decided to get her a little
present.

JERRY
What are you going to get her?

ELAINE
A very traditional, a very supportive, brazier.

JERRY
There's nothing subtle about that.

GEORGE
No, no, she might just think its a gift.

JERRY
Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?

(SCENE
The coffee shop)

GEORGE
Ahhh, Hey-Ho.

JERRY
What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at
work?!?

GEORGE
Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan
for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin! 

JERRY
So, you're just taking off from work?

GEORGE
They won't know. I got the car there.

JERRY
Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the
verge of this big promotion?

GEORGE
My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.

(SCENE
Elaine's office at J Peterman)

RECEPTIONIST ON INTERCOM
Sue Ellen Mishke to see you.

ELAINE
Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.
(Sue Ellen enters, wearing the brazier as a top, with a black blazer)

SUE ELLEN
Hi Elaine.

ELAINE
Hellllloo.

SUE ELLEN
I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop
in, and thank you for your lovely gift.

ELAINE
Ohhhhh. You're....welcome.

SUE ELLEN
Is anything wrong?

ELAINE
Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.

SUE ELLEN
Oh, I know. Thanks again.

(SCENE
The Rosses cabin)

GEORGE
This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?

SUSAN
Wanna check out a swap meet?

GEORGE
Yeah, maybe. Where'd you get that?

SUSAN
Oh, it was on the windshield of the car when we came out of that
rest stop.
(George sits up suddenly)

(SCENE
Jerry's apartment, phone ringing)

JERRY (ANSWERING PHONE)
Yello.

GEORGE
Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.

JERRY
What's goin' on?

GEORGE
I just remembered, there's this Chinese restaurant out near
Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.

JERRY
Yeah, so?

GEORGE
Alright, this is what ya gotta do: I need ya to go out to the
parking lot at Yankee Stadium, and take the flyers off my car.

JERRY
You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three
floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off
your car, where does it end?!?

GEORGE
Alright, alright. I'll drive the 4 hours each way, 6 hours all
together, and take 'em off myself!!

JERRY
Alright, alright, I'll do it!!
(Jerry hangs up, Kramer enters Jerry's apartment)

JERRY
Hey, what are ya up to?
Kramer. Nothin'.

JERRY
Do ya wanna go with me up to the Bronx and see if there's any
flyers on George's car.

KRAMER (EXCITED)
Sure!

JERRY
I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I?

KRAMER
yep.

(SCENE
Yankee Stadium parking lot.)
(George's car is covered with flyers bird droppings)

JERRY
Oh, man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if
they see this? What are we gonna do?

KRAMER
I don't know.

JERRY
Well, we gotta get it washed....Ah, the keys are locked inside!

KRAMER
Wait a second....

JERRY
What are ya gonna do?

KRAMER
I'll just snag the lock with this. Here we go...

JERRY
Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?

(SCENE
Jerry and Kramer driving George's car, after the car wash.
Kramer is behind the wheel.)

KRAMER
George has gotta be happy about this.

JERRY (INDIFFERENT)
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

JERRY
Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?
(Sue Ellen is seen walking down the street)

KRAMER
Oh, mama.

JERRY
Kramer!!!
(Car crashes into a lamp post)
(Commercial)

(SCENE
Jerry's Apartment)

ELAINE
My God, are you okay?

KRAMER
I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder.

JERRY
I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it
can make it.

ELAINE
So how did this happen?

JERRY
He was starin' at some woman!

KRAMER
I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.

ELAINE
What woman?

JERRY
There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing
just a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.

ELAINE
Oh...my God.

JERRY
What?

ELAINE
Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?

JERRY
Yeah!

ELAINE
Ohhh! That's Sue Ellen Mishke! 

JERRY
Sue Ellen Mishke?

ELAINE
That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The
woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on,
she's a menace to society.

KRAMER
You know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my
golf swing. 
(Kramer makes a golf swing motion and collapses in pain)
(Stan enters)

STAN (OUT OF BREATH)
I got your message, how's the shoulder?

KRAMER
Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!

STAN
No, no. Not the left arm!

KRAMER
What happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour,
and all my dreams?

ELAINE
Oh! I got it! Let's sue her!

KRAMER
Sue her?

ELAINE
Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar
fortune.

KRAMER
No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee
company.

ELAINE
Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime
opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held
accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!

KRAMER
What do you think, Stan?

STAN
Let's go for the green! You know a good lawyer?
(Kramer smiles)

(SCENE
Jackie Chiles' office)

JACKIE
So you're driving in the car, you're with your friend, minding
your own business?

KRAMER
Yeah.

JACKIE
Then what happened?

KRAMER
The we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.

JACKIE
No top? She didn't have a top on? 

KRAMER
No. So I got distracted and I crashed the car.

JACKIE
Well how would you describe this woman? Would you say she was
an attractive woman?

KRAMER
Oh, yeah.

JACKIE
So we got an attractive woman, wearing a bra, no top, walkin'
around in broad daylight. She's flouting society's conventions! 

KRAMER
She was flouting.

JACKIE
That's totally inappropriate. It's lewd, vesivius, salacious,
outrageous!

KRAMER
It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar
fortune.

JACKIE
Could you repeat that?

KRAMER
I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.

JACKIE
O'Henry? That's one of our top-selling candy bars. It's got
chocolate, peanuts, nougat, it's delicious, scrumptious, outstanding!
Have you been to a doctor?

KRAMER
No.

JACKIE (SPEAKING TO THE INTERCOM)
Susie, call Dr. Bison, set up an
appointment for Mr. Kramer, tell him it's for me.

KRAMER
So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?

JACKIE
Like taking candy from a baby.

(SCENE
The cabin)

GEORGE
I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim
Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think?
That way you have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got
a team! Ha ha ha.

SUSAN
I don't know, George. I'm still worried about this car thing.

GEORGE
Would ya stop worrying? 

SUSAN
Well, what about the flyers?

GEORGE
Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing
covered.

(SCENE
Yankee Stadium parking lot)
(Jerry having difficulty parking the car. After getting the car in the
space, Jerry leans against the door, trying to close it. Finally he
gives up and leaves, kicking a piece of the car under it as he goes)

(SCENE
Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner's office, someone is knocking)

STEINBRENNER
Come in!
(Wilhelm enters)

STEINBRENNER
Ah, Wilhelm.

WILHELM
Mr. Steinbrenner, I am very concerned about George Costanza.

STEINBRENNER
How 'bout a 'good morning'?

WILHELM
Yes sir, good morning, good morning, sir.

STEINBRENNER
Good morning to you, Wilhelm.

WILHELM
Anyway, his car's in the parking lot, the front end is based
in, and there's blood in the car, and we can't find him anywhere.
Obviously he was in some sort of terrible car accident, and, trooper
that he is, he tried to make it into work, sir.

STEINBRENNER
Alright, Wilhelm, listen to me. I want the stadium
scoured. He could be bleeding to death in the bullpen. Put everyone on
alert, check all the area hospitals, clinics, shelters, we've gotta find
that kid. 

WILHELM
Yes sir, yes sir.

STEINBRENNER
We must find George, find him, Wilhelm!

(SCENE
The hallway in Jerry's building)
(As Jerry walks down the hall to his apartment, he finds Sue Ellen
knocking on Kramer's door)

SUE ELLEN
Excuse me, do you happen to know the gentleman across the
hall?

JERRY (MESMERIZED)
Yes, yes, I do.

SUE ELLEN
Do you happen to know if he'll be back anytime soon?

JERRY
No, I don't.

SUE ELLEN
Oh...

JERRY
Is there something I can help you with?

SUE ELLEN
No, I really just needed to speak with him.

JERRY
Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.

SUE ELLEN
Oh, maybe I will.
(Jerry quickly unlocks his door, before she can change her mind)

SUE ELLEN
If you don't mind.

JERRY
No, no, not at all.

SUE ELLEN
Thanks.

JERRY
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.

(SCENE
Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner's office, someone is knocking)

STEINBRENNER
What is with these people, all day long. Come in, come
in.

WILHELM
Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, you know, we've searched everywhere,
there's no sign of him. Not even anyone who remotely fits his
description, sir.

STEINBRENNER
Oh my God, do you know what this means, Wilhelm? 

WILHELM
What, sir?

STEINBRENNER
He's dead! Costanza's dead!

WILHELM
Well, no, no, you see, I don't think--

STEINBRENNER
As quickly as he came here, he's gone. The poor little
guy! Easy. Easy, big Stein, get it together. Ok, Wilhelm.

WILHELM
Yessir?

STEINBRENNER
Find out where his parents live.

WILHELM
Parents.

STEINBRENNER
I'm gonna personally notify them. ...and, ah, line up
some candidates to fill that assistant to the General Manager position,
we can't grieve forever! We gotta get back to business! Back to
Business Wilhelm!

(SCENE
Jerry's Apartment)
(Kramer enters)

KRAMER
Well, buddy, he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on
it! Right on it, he's all over it!

JERRY (NOT HAPPY)
Oh, really?

KRAMER
Why, wh-wh-what's wrong, come on?

JERRY
I don't know, so the woman was walking around in a bra, I mean
it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching
the road. 

KRAMER
Well, your attitude has certainly changed.

JERRY
I don't think my attitude has changed.

KRAMER
Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.

JERRY
Well, I don't know if I....

KRAMER
Jerry, Jerry, you gotta testify!

JERRY
I don't think I--

KRAMER
Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry,
now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team,
Jerry!

JERRY
Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.

KRAMER
Alright what's gotten into you, what's happened?!?

JERRY
Nothing's happened.

KRAMER (IN DISGUST)
Goohhhhck. 
(As Kramer begins to leave, he notices an O'Henry wrapper in the garbage
can)

KRAMER (PICKING UP THE WRAPPER)
Ohhhh, what's this?

JERRY
Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second,...

KRAMER
I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't
she?

JERRY
Kramer, it is not what you think.

KRAMER
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over
this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're
willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down
the river.

JERRY
And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander
out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality
O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!

KRAMER
You're just out for sex!

JERRY
You're just out for money!

KRAMER AND JERRY (TOGETHER)
Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh!

(SCENE
The Costanza house, Queens)
(Steinbrenner is knocking, Estelle open the door)

STEINBRENNER
Mrs. Costanza?

ESTELLE (SMILING)
Yesss?

STEINBRENNER
My name is George Steinbrenner, I'm afraid I have some
very sad new about your son.
(Scene changes to Costanza living room)

ESTELLE (CRYING)
I can't believe it, he was so young. How could this
have happened?

STEINBRENNER
Well, he'd been logging some pretty heavy hours, first
one in in the morning, last one to leave at night. That kid was a human
dynamo.

ESTELLE
Are you sure you're talking about George?

STEINBRENNER
You are Mr. and Mrs. Costanza?

FRANK (YELLING)
What the hell did you trade Jay Buhner for?!? He had
30 home runs, over 100 RBIs last year, he's got a rocket for an arm, you
don't know what the hell you're doin'!!

STEINBRENNER
Well, Buener was a good prospect, no question about it. 
But my baseball people love Ken Phelps' bat. They kept saying 'Ken
Phelps , Ken Phelps'.

(SCENE
Jerry entering his apartment, as Frank is leaving a message on
his answering machine)

FRANK (FROM THE ANSWERING MACHINE)
Jerry, it's Frank Costanza, Mr.
Steinbrenner is here, George is dead, call me back!
(The phone rings again)

JERRY (ANSWERING PHONE)
Hello?

GEORGE (OTHER END OF PHONE)
Hey, it's George. 

JERRY
Where have you been?!?

GEORGE
What?

JERRY
I just got the most bizarre message from you father,
Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!

GEORGE
Dead? 

JERRY
Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a little
crumpled.

GEORGE
My car is a little crumpled?!?

JERRY
Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the
stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw
the blood, they couldn't find ya, and now that's why Steinbrenner thinks
you're dead!

GEORGE
Okay, I gotta head back right away, I'll -- I gotta figure
something out here.

JERRY
Well you gotta call your parents.

GEORGE
I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!

JERRY
Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?

GEORGE
Nnnooo! They could use the break!

(SCENE
Elaine's office at J Peterman)
(Elaine is at her desk, Peterman enters)

PETERMAN (HOLDING UP A BRA)
Elaine, do you see this? Do you see what
I'm holding is my hands?

ELAINE
Yeah, it's a bra.

PETERMAN
I saw a woman in our hallway wearing one of these as a top.
What exquisite beauty, I ran down the hallway to talk to her, but the
elevator door closed. It was not to be. Perhaps our paths will cross
again some day.

ELAINE
What is this all about?

PETERMAN
I wanna market this item as a new direction in women's

FASHION. WE'RE GONNA SELL THIS AS A TOP. HERE'S THE ANGLE
Zelda
Fitzgerald, aaaand, somebody in the 20s, wearing this at wild parties,
driving all the men crazy.....Have it on my desk by the end of the week.

(SCENE
Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner's office, someone is knocking)

STEINBRENNER
Come in, come in.
(George enters, with a bandage on his head, walking with crutches)

GEORGE
Mr. Steinbrenner--

STEINBRENNER (SHOCKED)
Ahhh, Ahhh! Ah, ah ah! Is it you? 

GEORGE
Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. After the
car accident, I crawled into a ditch and managed to survive on grubs and
puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.

STEINBRENNER
Grubs, huh? Gotta admit, I never tasted one of those. 

GEORGE
Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I think I may have found
a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up
that much.

STEINBRENNER
Well, don't tell it to me George, tell it to the new
Assistant to the General Manager.

GEORGE
I didn't get the job?

STEINBRENNER
Well, once you were dead, we couldn't just sit on our
hands. We had to make a move...
(Dejected, George turns to leave, no longer walking with he crutches,
and takes the bandage off his head)

STEINBRENNER
But, you still have your old job. Of course, we'll have
to dock you for the time you missed. We're running a ball club here.
If I give special treatment to you, everyone will want it. Next thing
you know its chaos! And I can tell you this, chaos does not work for
the New York Yankees! Not as long as I'm running the show!

(SCENE
Courtroom)

JACKIE
So it was the meeting on the street that prompted you to buy
the bra for Miss Mishke, would you say that was correct?

ELAINE (ON THE WITNESS STAND)
Yes...ummm, yes, that's correct.
(Sue Ellen leans back and smiles at Jerry, Kramer notices, worried)

JACKIE
And you have also brought with you, another bra, exactly like
the one that she so flagrantly exhibited herself in!

ELAINE
Yes, that's correct.
(Kramer is now on the witness stand)

JACKIE
What was you golf score, the last round you played...before you
shoulder was injured?

KRAMER
Three under par.
(Stan nods proudly)

JACKIE (IMPRESSED)
Oooohhhh, three under par...That's what the
professionals shoot, isn't it?

KRAMER
If they're lucky.
(Stan laughs)
(Jerry is now on the witness stand)

JACKIE
Would you tell this jury exactly what you saw on the corner of
83rd Street and Columbus?

JERRY (HESITANT)
I...don't remember.

JACKIE
Well, did you, or did you not, see the defendant, wearing the
bra?

JERRY
I don't know. Maybe.

JACKIE
Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you that you are under oath. Now
I ask you again, did you or did you not, see this woman wearing the
bra?!?

JERRY
....Alright, alright, I saw her! And she was beautiful in that
bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free
wheeling attitude!

JUDGE (BANGING HIS GAVEL)
This court will come to order!

JACKIE
No further questions, your honor.

JUDGE
You may step down.

JACKIE (TO KRAMER)
I think we got this wrapped up.

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?

STAN
You're close, you're on the green. You just have to go for the
cup.

KRAMER
What do you mean?

STAN
Have her try on the bra, see if it fits.

JACKIE
No, no, no, no! 

KRAMER
Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.

JACKIE
Stan? Who the hell is Stan? 

KRAMER
He's my caddy.

JACKIE
You're caddy?!? This is a big mistake! 

KRAMER
G- cada-

JACKIE
Your honor, we request at this time, that Miss Mishke...try on
the bra.

JUDGE
This court will come to order! Go ahead Miss Mishke, try it on.
(Sue Ellen proceeds to try on the bra, over her top, but it seems too
small)

SUE ELLEN
Ah, it doesn't fit...I can't put it on.

JACKIE (TO KRAMER AND STAN)
Damn fools! Look at that! We got nothin'
now, nothin'! I've been practicing law for 25 years, you're listenin'
to a caddy! This is a public humiliation! You can't let the defendant
have control of the key piece of evidence. Plus, she's trying it on
over a leotard, of course a bra's not gonna fit on over a leotard. A
bra gotta fit right up a person's skin, like a glove!

(SCENE
Elaine's office)
(Two women enter wearing bras as tops)

WOMAN #1
Oh, hey, Elaine, how 'bout some lunch?

ELAINE
Oh, no, I don't think so.

WOMAN #2
Great job on the Gatzby Swing Top. It's a winner.

ELAINE
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

WOMAN #1
Are you sure you don't wanna go? We have reservations. 

ELAINE
Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.

WOMAN #1
Ciao.

WOMAN #2
Ba-bye.
(Elaine makes a gun with her fingers and points it to her head)
End.
[Nightclub]
Jerry's standup piece.

JERRY
I love it when people are complimented on something they're
wearing and they accept the compliment as if it was about them. "Nice tie." "Well,
thank you. Thank you very much." The compliment is for the tie, it's not for
you, but we take it. That's kind of the job of clothes; to get compliments for
us, because it's very hard to get compliments based on your human
qualities. Right? Let's face it, no matter how nice a person you are, nobody's gonna come
Say "Hey, nice person." It's much easier to be a bastard and just try and
match the colours up.
 
[Antique Toy Store]
Elaine and Jerry enter a store stocked with the toys of yesteryear.
They look around at the array of classic teddy bears, toy boats, puppets, etc.

ELAINE
(awed) Oh, look at this!

JERRY
Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
Something on the wall catches Elaine's eye. It's an old-fashioned
girl's bicycle, with high handlebars, a pink frame and a basket on the front.

ELAINE
(excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!
Jerry looks over, but his eye is drawn more towards an attractive
woman, Christie, who stands looking at the toys. She's wearing a dress of
mid-thigh length, black from the bottom of the ribs down, and white on the chest
and arms.

JERRY
(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.

ELAINE
(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's
model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
Christie leaves her examination of the toys on that side of the store,
and walks over to some other items. Jerry watches her as she goes, she notices
and smiles and flirtatious looks are exchanged. Jerry is oblivious to Elaine's
voice.

ELAINE
What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?

JERRY
(tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?

ELAINE
What d'you think?

JERRY
Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.

ELAINE
(laughs) I love it. I'm getting it.
Elaine reaches for the bike, as Jerry turns back to Christie.

ELAINE
Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.

CHRISTIE
I think your friend needs some help over there.

JERRY
You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
Elaine gives up on Jerry assisting her and tries to lift the bike off
the wall on her own. But as she raises it, the weight proves too much and she
falls backwards, ending up on her back on the floor with the bike pinning her
down. She struggles to lift it, but can't make much impression, so she rings
the bell on the bike. Jerry finally has his attention drawn away from Christie.

ELAINE
Hey!
Elaine makes 'So, are you gonna help me?' gestures.
 
[Restaurant]
George and Susan are having dinner with Ken and Carrie. Carrie is
Heavily pregnant. George is eating spaghetti with his usual decorum.

SUSAN
A little baby girl?

KEN
Doctor says it could be any day now.

GEORGE
(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are
cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what
does that make me?

CARRIE
Doesn't make you anything.

GEORGE
(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
George laughs and shovels another load of pasta into his mouth. Ken and
Carrie look perturbed.

SUSAN
So, have you picked out a name yet?

CARRIE
Well, we've narrowed it down to a few. We like Kimberley.

SUSAN
Aww.

GEORGE
(negative) Hu-ho, boy.

KEN
You don't like Kimberley?

GEORGE
Ech. What else you got?

KEN
How about Joan?

GEORGE
Aw c'mon, I'm eating here.

SUSAN
(warning) George!

CARRIE
Pamela?

GEORGE
Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people,
I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.

KEN
What?

GEORGE
Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.

CARRIE
I don't know, it sounds a little strange.

GEORGE
All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you
Telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?

KEN
Yeah, but uh... Soda?

GEORGE
Yeah, that's right. It's working.

CARRIE
We'll put it on the list.

GEORGE
I solve problems. That's just what I do.
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry sits in front of the TV, while in the kitchen Kramer is building
A sandwich of epic proportions. He hums to himself as he piles sliced
meat onto bread. Jerry looks over at him, looking somewhat irritated by the way
Kramer's demolishing his food stocks.

KRAMER
(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.

JERRY
You're really going to town with that turkey there.

KRAMER
Oh yeah, I got a big appetite.
Kramer goes to the fridge and looks inside.

KRAMER
Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.

JERRY
It's on the door.

KRAMER
(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff?
No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
Kramer waves away the squeezy option and shuts the fridge.

KRAMER
Ah, 's no good.
Kramer goes back to his sandwich, puts the second slice of bread on,
and takes a bite. It doesn't meet with his approval. He spits out the mouthful he's
taken onto the plate, and dumps the rest of the sandwich next to it.

KRAMER
No. That's bush league.
Kramer heads toward the door.

JERRY
Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there?
That's like half a pound of turkey!

KRAMER
No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without
Dijon.

JERRY
(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your
favourites on hand.

KRAMER
Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy
with our arrangement?

JERRY
What arrangement?

KRAMER
Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I
Wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.

JERRY
(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there
and I will.
Elaine enters. She has her head leaning over to the left, and she's
Moving carefully, like it's giving her pain.

KRAMER
Oh, hey.

ELAINE
Hey.

JERRY
Hey. What's with your neck?

ELAINE
Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall.
(pointedly) By myself.

JERRY
Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.

ELAINE
(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.

JERRY
Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.

ELAINE
Ach, maybe.

JERRY
Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.

ELAINE
I don't know.

JERRY
Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned
it...

ELAINE
(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the
hell up?

JERRY
Awright.

ELAINE
God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike
to the first person who could make this pain go away.

KRAMER
Aw, you really hurting, huh?

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.

KRAMER
Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted.
Kramer walks around behind the seated Elaine, and reaches for her neck.

KRAMER
Alright, lean forward, relax.

ELAINE
(worried) What? What?

KRAMER
Encounter shiatsu.
Kramer begins to work at Elaine's neck with his thumbs.

ELAINE
Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?

KRAMER
(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the
Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.

ELAINE
Ah hah.

KRAMER
(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.

ELAINE
(seriously worried) Wha...?

KRAMER
He's a genius. Here we go...
Kramer takes a firm grip of each side of Elaine's head. Elaine looks
Really worried now. She grabs a hold of Jerry's shirt and the arm of the
couch, and her feet stamp on the floor.

KRAMER
From pain, will come pleasure.
Kramer violently twists Elaine's head to the left. There's a loud
Crunching sound, and Elaine cries out in shock. Kramer lets go of her head and
steps away, job done.

KRAMER
Uh? Voila.

ELAINE
(pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!

KRAMER
Yeah.
Elaine rolls her head around, completely comfortable.

ELAINE
Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!

JERRY
What's even more amazing is his formal training is in
paediatrics.

KRAMER
Awright, my work is done here.
Kramer heads for the door.

ELAINE
(big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!

KRAMER
(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.

ELAINE
(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?

JERRY
I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to
anyone who fixes your neck.

ELAINE
You really think he wants the bike?

JERRY
Oh yeah.

ELAINE
It took him like ten seconds!

JERRY
Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
 
[George's Car]
George and Susan, heading home from the restaurant. George is happy,
smiling and whistling.

GEORGE
I think they really went for that Soda.

SUSAN
What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring
you.

GEORGE
Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.

SUSAN
I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.

GEORGE
Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A
Real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?

SUSAN
Yeah.
George uses his finger to draw a number 7 in the air, accompanying the
Strokes of his digit with a two-tone whistle.

SUSAN
What is that? Sign language?

GEORGE
No, Seven.

SUSAN
Seven Costanza? You're serious?

GEORGE
Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
Susan scoffs.

GEORGE
...especially a girl. Or a boy.

SUSAN
I don't think so.

GEORGE
What, you don't like the name?

SUSAN
It's not a name. It's a number.

GEORGE
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all
Around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.

SUSAN
It's awful. I hate it!

GEORGE
(angry) Well, that's the name!

SUSAN
(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to
be named Seven!

GEORGE
(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all
crazy on me!
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry walks from the bathroom, talking to George, who's just told him
about his contretemps with Susan.

JERRY
Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of
school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually
seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.

GEORGE
(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name
than Seven.
Jerry walks toward the kitchen. He sees an item on the counter.

JERRY
Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug
Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup?
Pretty name for a girl.

GEORGE
Alright, you having a good time there?
Jerry is in the kitchen, and opens a cupboard. His eyes run over the
array of good within.

JERRY
I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik?
Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.

GEORGE
(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me,
Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
Jerry comes back into the living room. A thought occurs.

JERRY
Oh, I forgot to call Christie.

GEORGE
Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?

JERRY
Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop
neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.

GEORGE
And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do
it!

JERRY
(smug) I'm not engaged.
George gives Jerry a look. Kramer enters. He's carrying a small
goldfish bowl, a pad and a pencil tied to the bowl by string.

KRAMER
Ah, I got it.

JERRY
Got what?

KRAMER
(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry.
Refrigerator problem, is solved.

JERRY
Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.

KRAMER
Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I
want.
Kramer takes a cupcake from a box on the counter.

KRAMER
Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I
put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the
bowl) There. Very simple.

JERRY
Sort of a mooching inventory.

KRAMER
No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em
all up, and you give me the bill.

JERRY
Alright.

KRAMER
Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When
Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
George passes by as he goes to the fridge.

JERRY
Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.

KRAMER
Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other
at our word, all is lost.
George has fetched a Diet Coke from the fridge. He opens it. Kramer
hears the hiss, and notices George.

KRAMER
(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
 
[Restaurant]
Jerry and Christie have just arrived. They're both wearing long coats,
Fastened to the collar.

JERRY
Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the
best in the city.
A member of staff approaches.

MAITRE D'
May I take your coat, miss?

CHRISTIE
Yes, thank you.
The Maitre d' helps Christie to slip out of her coat, revealing that
she has on the exact same dress as she was wearing in the antique store. Jerry
looks bemused, but plasters on a fixed smile as Christie looks at him.
 
[Monks']
Jerry and George sit in a booth, discussing the previous night. George
Fingers his chin thoughtfully.

GEORGE
The same outfit?

JERRY
The exact same outfit.

GEORGE
How many days was it between encounters.

JERRY
Three.

GEORGE
Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new
wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got
clean and she started all over again.

JERRY
Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at
the end of the cycle?

GEORGE
Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.

JERRY
Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?

GEORGE
Very curious.

JERRY
Indeed.

GEORGE
You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.

JERRY
Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.

GEORGE
(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.

JERRY
Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?

GEORGE
(standing) Not yet, but she's weakening.

JERRY
You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't
Destroy someone else's.

GEORGE
It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol.

JERRY
How about 'Mickey'?

GEORGE
'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!
George walks away, half-laughing at Jerry's ludicrous suggestion.
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is in the fridge. Kramer enters with a slide of the feet, and a
cigar in his mouth.

KRAMER
Hey buddy.

JERRY
(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the
fridge?

KRAMER
No, that's yours. My half is gone.

JERRY
What?

KRAMER
Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your
beef?

JERRY
You cannot buy half a can of soda.

KRAMER
Well, why not.

JERRY
Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation
with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?

KRAMER
Yeah.

JERRY
That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes
for this, okay...
Jerry holds up an apple, from which has been taken one large bite.

JERRY
...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought
the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
Jerry hold up a half banana.

KRAMER
Alright.

JERRY
...You bite it, you bought it.

KRAMER
Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.

JERRY
Thank you.

KRAMER
Yeah.
Elaine enters.

ELAINE
Hey.

KRAMER
Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?

ELAINE
Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even
know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.

KRAMER
(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.

ELAINE
No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like
saying,
you're hungry enough to eat a horse.

KRAMER
Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He
gets it from his butcher.

ELAINE
This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't
have the bike.

KRAMER
Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are
the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I
can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
Kramer holds one hand up above his head.

KRAMER
I always put you up here...
Kramer holds his other hand at about knee height.

KRAMER
...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
Kramer brings his first hand down to the level of the second. He
leaves, closing the door with a bang. Elaine sits, fighting with her conscience. There
is a brief pause, then the door opens again and Kramer pokes in his head,
expectantly.

ELAINE
(grudging) Alright.

KRAMER
(points) Digidi.
Kramer leaves and closes the door again.
 
[Restaurant]
George and Susan are having dinner.

GEORGE
Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody
else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.

SUSAN
Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.

GEORGE
Why not?

SUSAN
Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told
them the name, they just loved it.

GEORGE
So, what're you saying?

SUSAN
They're gonna name their baby Seven.

GEORGE
(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name,
I made it up!

SUSAN
I can't believe that they're using it.

GEORGE
(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose
all its cachet!

SUSAN
I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.

GEORGE
(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the
yin-yang!
 
[Elaine's Apartment]
Elaine is in bed. She begins to move to get up. As she raises herself
from the mattress, there is a loud crunching sound. A look of agony crosses her
face.

ELAINE
(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
 
[Street]
Elaine walks along the street. Her neck problem means she has her head
Tipped back so far she can't see directly in front of her. A guy coming the
other way gives her a warning.

MAN
Watch your step.
Elaine collides with a litter bin which is outside her field of vision.

ELAINE
(pain) Oh, ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer.
Christie is looking in a shop window, then she spots Elaine.

CHRISTIE
Excuse me. Elaine?
Elaine, handicapped by her neck, cannot see who's speaking.

ELAINE
Huh?
Christie comes over to Elaine. All Elaine can see of her is her head
and neck.

CHRISTIE
Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend,
right?

ELAINE
Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?

CHRISTIE
Yes. How y'doing?

ELAINE
(bearing up) I'm fine.

CHRISTIE
Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you.
Christie walks away.

ELAINE
(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
Kramer comes along the street, riding the Schwinn Stingray and ringing
the bell. He attracts comments from folk on the street.

VOICE 1 (O.C.)
Lookin' good.

VOICE 2 (O.C.)
Hey Cosmo, nice wheels.

KRAMER
You got that right!
A kid leans out the window of a parked Volvo.

KID
(scorn) Hey, you're riding a girl's bike.
Kramer thumbs his nose and continues pedalling.

ELAINE
(shouting) Kramer! Kramer!
 
[Outside Apartment Building]
George walks up to the door. He pushes the buzzer for a particular
apartment.

KEN (O.C.)
Hello.

GEORGE
Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry hears a loud knocking from the hallway.

ELAINE (O.C.)
(angry shout) Kramer!
Jerry opens the door to reveal Elaine hammering insistently at Kramer's
door.

ELAINE
Kramer!!

JERRY
Hey
Elaine turns to Jerry and gets a twinge from her neck.

ELAINE
Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
Elaine enters Jerry's apartment.

JERRY
Haven't seen him. How's the neck?

ELAINE
His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was
before.
Elaine removes her bag from her back, wincing from the pain as she
moves.

JERRY
Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a
knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.

ELAINE
Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the
antique store. What's her name, Christie?

JERRY
You saw her? What was she wearing?

ELAINE
I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of
my neck.

JERRY
Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?

ELAINE
What d'you care?

JERRY
Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
There's a ringing from the Schwinn's bell, and Kramer rides it into
Jerry's apartment. He rides all around the apartment, round the couch, past the
TV and is heading for the door.

ELAINE
Did you have a nice ride?

KRAMER
Oh, great ride.

ELAINE
Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
Elaine slams the door shut before Kramer can leave. Kramer rides
straight into the door with a clatter. He falls to the ground, then makes his
stumbling way upright again.

KRAMER
What're you talking about?! We had a deal!

ELAINE
(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck)
Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.

KRAMER
Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a
week.

ELAINE
What? You never told me that.

KRAMER
Well, it's common sense.

ELAINE
Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.

KRAMER
Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should
settle this.

ELAINE
Yeah Jerry.

JERRY
Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but
unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting
involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.

ELAINE
Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?

KRAMER
Alright, I'm down.

JERRY
Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story
before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose
heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of
any kind.
 
[Newman's Apartment]
Elaine and Kramer sit on Newman's couch. Elaine with her head tilted
back. Newman sits in his chair, his fingertips together, trying to give an
Impression of limitless wisdom.

ELAINE
So, that's the situation.

NEWMAN
Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly
has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one
rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is
all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages
who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels
into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...

KRAMER
Newman!
Newman catches himself, and comes back to normality.

NEWMAN
...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no
Matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?

KRAMER
Uh, yeah.

ELAINE
Yeah.

NEWMAN
Alright, let's begin.
Newman sits back, to begin his contemplation. There is the single
'ting' of a microwave.

NEWMAN
(excited) Ooh, my cocoa!
Newman leaps to his feet and heads for his kitchen.
 
[Ken and Carrie's Apartment]
Carrie is on the couch, with Ken sitting on the arm. George is
explaining about Seven.

KEN
Why can't we use Seven?

GEORGE
It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.

CARRIE
Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant. You've already postponed
The wedding. Who knows if you'll ever get married.

GEORGE
Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't
waffle!

KEN
Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name.
It's very unusual.

GEORGE
(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on
Soda.

KEN
(emphatic) Well, we don't care for Soda.

GEORGE
You don't care for Soda?!

CARRIE
(worked up) No, no. We don't like Soda at all!

GEORGE
(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's
refreshing!
Carrie jumps and gives a cry.

CARRIE
Oh!

KEN
What is it?

CARRIE
I felt something.

KEN
Are you okay, honey?

CARRIE
I think I'm going into labour.
George flashes a panicked expression.

KEN
Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the
hospital...
Ken and Carrie rise and head toward the door.

CARRIE
Okay.

KEN
...Alright? I got the suitcase packed, right here.
Ken grabs the suitcase from by the door and they exit, hurriedly.
George trails along behind them, making suggestions.

GEORGE
What about Six?
Ken gives him a look over his shoulder.

GEORGE
Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.
Ken has left, George follows out the door.

GEORGE
Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen!
George closes the door behind him.
 
[Restaurant]
Jerry and Christie are having dinner. Christie is eating, while Jerry
leans back picking at his meal, looking suspicious at the fact that Christie is
wearing the same black and white dress as at their two previous meetings.

CHRISTIE
Are you okay, Jerry? You seem quiet.

JERRY
No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.

CHRISTIE
I know exactly what you mean.

JERRY
Oh, I'm sure you do.
Christie begins to season her food, with salt. Jerry chews
thoughtfully.

JERRY (V.O.)
What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the
same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like
Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.
Christie adds a little pepper to her dish. But after replacing the
shaker, she knocks her glass of red wine over her dress.

CHRISTIE
(horrified) Oh my god!

JERRY
Oh.
Christie mops at the spill with her napkin, but there's only so much
you can do.

CHRISTIE
Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go
back to my apartment, so I can change?

JERRY
Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.
 
[Ken and Carrie's Car]
Ken is driving Carrie to the hospital. Carrie is as worked up as you'd
expect a woman in labor to be. In the back seat, George is making one last
attempt to save his name.

CARRIE
Are we almost there?

KEN
Just keep breathing, okay.

CARRIE
(deep breaths) Okay, okay.

KEN
Okay.

GEORGE
(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow
Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
As George speaks, Ken is looking impatient and angry.

KEN
Now's not the best time, George!

GEORGE
(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...

KEN
(firm) George! She's in labour!

GEORGE
(angry shout) So am I!
 
[Newman's Apartment]
Elaine and Kramer still sit on the couch, awaiting Newman's
arbitration.

NEWMAN
Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the
one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
Kramer looks at Elaine, thinking his arguments have put him one up.

NEWMAN
And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for
compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance
Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer.
Not for any man...
Kramer leans forward to receive the result. Elaine looks as attentive
as she can while only being able to look upwards.

NEWMAN
...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the
bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.

ELAINE
(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
Newman's face drops at her negative reaction. Kramer looks across at
the bike, looking worried.

ELAINE
Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing
in half.

KRAMER
No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another
than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.

ELAINE
Yeah, yeah, y-yeah.

NEWMAN
Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather
give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!

ELAINE
What?!

KRAMER
Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise.
Kramer picks up the bike and climbs aboard.

ELAINE
(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still
hurting me,
and now you have the bike?!

KRAMER
Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
Kramer opens the door and rides clumsily out, ringing the bell as he
goes.
 
[Christie's Apartment]
Christie leads Jerry into her home.

CHRISTIE
Here we are.

JERRY
(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
Christie puts down her bag, and removes her coat.

CHRISTIE
Well, I guess I'll go change.

JERRY
Yes, change. By all means, change.
Christie walks away down a hallway. Jerry removes his coat and sits
down. He looks around himself. On the coffee table he notices a small framed
picture of Christie and some guy. In the picture, she's wearing the same black and
White dress. Jerry picks it up and examines it more closely, reading a date
written on the photo.

JERRY (V.O.)
August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress!
She never
changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these
dresses.
Jerry gets up from his seat.

JERRY (V.O.)
There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
Jerry opens a closet and begins to look inside. While he's rooting
about in there, Christie reenters the room, wearing a robe and looking indignant
at discovering Jerry invading her privacy.

CHRISTIE
Ahem! Are you looking for something?

JERRY
What're you doing? I thought you were changing.

CHRISTIE
No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night.

JERRY
No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.

CHRISTIE
If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to
bed.
Jerry moves to the couch, where he half lays down.

JERRY
You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on
The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out
together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll
of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go
downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.

CHRISTIE
(unequivocal) Jerry. I don't think so.
Jerry picks up his coat and moves toward the door.

JERRY
You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?

CHRISTIE
(gesturing) Get out.
Jerry walks though the door. He's still talking as Christie closes it
on him.

JERRY
(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you
lay it out on the bed.
 
[Hospital]
Carrie is in a wheelchair, being wheeled by an orderly. She's doing her
breathing. Ken hurries alongside, comforting his wife. George also
hustles along the corridor with the group.

KEN
Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe.

GEORGE
(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It
would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!

CARRIE
(shouts) I'm having a baby!!
The orderly pushes the wheelchair on through the door of the delivery
room. Ken turns to face George.

KEN
George, you're not getting Seven! Now get outta here!!
Ken strides into the delivery room.

GEORGE
(desperate) Please! I have so little!
George tries to follow, but an orderly blocks his path.

ORDERLY
Sorry sir, it's family only.
The orderly closes the door on George, whose face can be seen through
The window.

GEORGE
I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
George thumps his fists against the door in frustration. He's crying as
He screams.

GEORGE
Seven!!
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is on the phone, while Kramer examines a box of cereal in the
kitchen.

JERRY
Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again?
(listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone.
C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can
bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me.
(hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
Defeated, Jerry hangs up the phone.

KRAMER
(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking
On these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.

JERRY
Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little
Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
Jerry tears a sheet off a writing pad, and presents it to Kramer.
Kramer takes a look.

KRAMER
(does a double take) Yikes.

JERRY
I know. Pretty steep.

KRAMER
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.

JERRY
Few do.

KRAMER
I'm good for it.

JERRY
Yeah, well, until this bill is paid...
Jerry takes back the tab, then takes the cereal out of Kramer's hands.

JERRY
...the food court is closed.

KRAMER
(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five
minutes. And, don't eat any more.
Kramer leaves at a run.
 
[Street]
Elaine is walking along, when she spots something ahead of her.

ELAINE
Hey, that's my bike!
Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn
for all he's worth. He rings the bell.

NEWMAN
Gangway!

ELAINE
This is my bike!
Newman brakes to a halt in front of Elaine.

NEWMAN
Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for
cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make
some minor modifications, you know. Solid tyres, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty
shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
Newman begins to ride away.

ELAINE
(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman,
gimme...
Elaine grabs hold of the trailing end of Newman's scarf.

NEWMAN
Hey!! Help me!
The show ends with a freeze frame of Newman on the bike, and a
determined Elaine grasping the scarf. There are sounds of a struggle.

[Nightclub]
Jerry's standup piece.

JERRY
I love it when people are complimented on something they're
wearing and they accept the compliment as if it was about them. "Nice tie." "Well,
thank you. Thank you very much." The compliment is for the tie, it's not for
you, but we take it. That's kind of the job of clothes; to get compliments for
us, because it's very hard to get compliments based on your human
qualities. Right? Let's face it, no matter how nice a person you are, nobody's gonna come
Say "Hey, nice person." It's much easier to be a bastard and just try and
match the colours up.
 
[Antique Toy Store]
Elaine and Jerry enter a store stocked with the toys of yesteryear.
They look around at the array of classic teddy bears, toy boats, puppets, etc.

ELAINE
(awed) Oh, look at this!

JERRY
Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
Something on the wall catches Elaine's eye. It's an old-fashioned
girl's bicycle, with high handlebars, a pink frame and a basket on the front.

ELAINE
(excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!
Jerry looks over, but his eye is drawn more towards an attractive
woman, Christie, who stands looking at the toys. She's wearing a dress of
mid-thigh length, black from the bottom of the ribs down, and white on the chest
and arms.

JERRY
(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.

ELAINE
(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's
model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
Christie leaves her examination of the toys on that side of the store,
and walks over to some other items. Jerry watches her as she goes, she notices
and smiles and flirtatious looks are exchanged. Jerry is oblivious to Elaine's
voice.

ELAINE
What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?

JERRY
(tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?

ELAINE
What d'you think?

JERRY
Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.

ELAINE
(laughs) I love it. I'm getting it.
Elaine reaches for the bike, as Jerry turns back to Christie.

ELAINE
Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.

CHRISTIE
I think your friend needs some help over there.

JERRY
You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
Elaine gives up on Jerry assisting her and tries to lift the bike off
the wall on her own. But as she raises it, the weight proves too much and she
falls backwards, ending up on her back on the floor with the bike pinning her
down. She struggles to lift it, but can't make much impression, so she rings
the bell on the bike. Jerry finally has his attention drawn away from Christie.

ELAINE
Hey!
Elaine makes 'So, are you gonna help me?' gestures.
 
[Restaurant]
George and Susan are having dinner with Ken and Carrie. Carrie is
Heavily pregnant. George is eating spaghetti with his usual decorum.

SUSAN
A little baby girl?

KEN
Doctor says it could be any day now.

GEORGE
(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are
cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what
does that make me?

CARRIE
Doesn't make you anything.

GEORGE
(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
George laughs and shovels another load of pasta into his mouth. Ken and
Carrie look perturbed.

SUSAN
So, have you picked out a name yet?

CARRIE
Well, we've narrowed it down to a few. We like Kimberley.

SUSAN
Aww.

GEORGE
(negative) Hu-ho, boy.

KEN
You don't like Kimberley?

GEORGE
Ech. What else you got?

KEN
How about Joan?

GEORGE
Aw c'mon, I'm eating here.

SUSAN
(warning) George!

CARRIE
Pamela?

GEORGE
Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people,
I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.

KEN
What?

GEORGE
Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.

CARRIE
I don't know, it sounds a little strange.

GEORGE
All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you
Telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?

KEN
Yeah, but uh... Soda?

GEORGE
Yeah, that's right. It's working.

CARRIE
We'll put it on the list.

GEORGE
I solve problems. That's just what I do.
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry sits in front of the TV, while in the kitchen Kramer is building
A sandwich of epic proportions. He hums to himself as he piles sliced
meat onto bread. Jerry looks over at him, looking somewhat irritated by the way
Kramer's demolishing his food stocks.

KRAMER
(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.

JERRY
You're really going to town with that turkey there.

KRAMER
Oh yeah, I got a big appetite.
Kramer goes to the fridge and looks inside.

KRAMER
Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.

JERRY
It's on the door.

KRAMER
(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff?
No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
Kramer waves away the squeezy option and shuts the fridge.

KRAMER
Ah, 's no good.
Kramer goes back to his sandwich, puts the second slice of bread on,
and takes a bite. It doesn't meet with his approval. He spits out the mouthful he's
taken onto the plate, and dumps the rest of the sandwich next to it.

KRAMER
No. That's bush league.
Kramer heads toward the door.

JERRY
Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there?
That's like half a pound of turkey!

KRAMER
No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without
Dijon.

JERRY
(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your
favourites on hand.

KRAMER
Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy
with our arrangement?

JERRY
What arrangement?

KRAMER
Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I
Wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.

JERRY
(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there
and I will.
Elaine enters. She has her head leaning over to the left, and she's
Moving carefully, like it's giving her pain.

KRAMER
Oh, hey.

ELAINE
Hey.

JERRY
Hey. What's with your neck?

ELAINE
Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall.
(pointedly) By myself.

JERRY
Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.

ELAINE
(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.

JERRY
Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.

ELAINE
Ach, maybe.

JERRY
Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.

ELAINE
I don't know.

JERRY
Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned
it...

ELAINE
(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the
hell up?

JERRY
Awright.

ELAINE
God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike
to the first person who could make this pain go away.

KRAMER
Aw, you really hurting, huh?

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.

KRAMER
Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted.
Kramer walks around behind the seated Elaine, and reaches for her neck.

KRAMER
Alright, lean forward, relax.

ELAINE
(worried) What? What?

KRAMER
Encounter shiatsu.
Kramer begins to work at Elaine's neck with his thumbs.

ELAINE
Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?

KRAMER
(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the
Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.

ELAINE
Ah hah.

KRAMER
(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.

ELAINE
(seriously worried) Wha...?

KRAMER
He's a genius. Here we go...
Kramer takes a firm grip of each side of Elaine's head. Elaine looks
Really worried now. She grabs a hold of Jerry's shirt and the arm of the
couch, and her feet stamp on the floor.

KRAMER
From pain, will come pleasure.
Kramer violently twists Elaine's head to the left. There's a loud
Crunching sound, and Elaine cries out in shock. Kramer lets go of her head and
steps away, job done.

KRAMER
Uh? Voila.

ELAINE
(pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!

KRAMER
Yeah.
Elaine rolls her head around, completely comfortable.

ELAINE
Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!

JERRY
What's even more amazing is his formal training is in
paediatrics.

KRAMER
Awright, my work is done here.
Kramer heads for the door.

ELAINE
(big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!

KRAMER
(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.

ELAINE
(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?

JERRY
I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to
anyone who fixes your neck.

ELAINE
You really think he wants the bike?

JERRY
Oh yeah.

ELAINE
It took him like ten seconds!

JERRY
Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
 
[George's Car]
George and Susan, heading home from the restaurant. George is happy,
smiling and whistling.

GEORGE
I think they really went for that Soda.

SUSAN
What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring
you.

GEORGE
Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.

SUSAN
I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.

GEORGE
Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A
Real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?

SUSAN
Yeah.
George uses his finger to draw a number 7 in the air, accompanying the
Strokes of his digit with a two-tone whistle.

SUSAN
What is that? Sign language?

GEORGE
No, Seven.

SUSAN
Seven Costanza? You're serious?

GEORGE
Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
Susan scoffs.

GEORGE
...especially a girl. Or a boy.

SUSAN
I don't think so.

GEORGE
What, you don't like the name?

SUSAN
It's not a name. It's a number.

GEORGE
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all
Around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.

SUSAN
It's awful. I hate it!

GEORGE
(angry) Well, that's the name!

SUSAN
(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to
be named Seven!

GEORGE
(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all
crazy on me!
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry walks from the bathroom, talking to George, who's just told him
about his contretemps with Susan.

JERRY
Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of
school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually
seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.

GEORGE
(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name
than Seven.
Jerry walks toward the kitchen. He sees an item on the counter.

JERRY
Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug
Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup?
Pretty name for a girl.

GEORGE
Alright, you having a good time there?
Jerry is in the kitchen, and opens a cupboard. His eyes run over the
array of good within.

JERRY
I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik?
Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.

GEORGE
(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me,
Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
Jerry comes back into the living room. A thought occurs.

JERRY
Oh, I forgot to call Christie.

GEORGE
Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?

JERRY
Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop
neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.

GEORGE
And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do
it!

JERRY
(smug) I'm not engaged.
George gives Jerry a look. Kramer enters. He's carrying a small
goldfish bowl, a pad and a pencil tied to the bowl by string.

KRAMER
Ah, I got it.

JERRY
Got what?

KRAMER
(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry.
Refrigerator problem, is solved.

JERRY
Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.

KRAMER
Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I
want.
Kramer takes a cupcake from a box on the counter.

KRAMER
Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I
put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the
bowl) There. Very simple.

JERRY
Sort of a mooching inventory.

KRAMER
No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em
all up, and you give me the bill.

JERRY
Alright.

KRAMER
Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When
Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
George passes by as he goes to the fridge.

JERRY
Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.

KRAMER
Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other
at our word, all is lost.
George has fetched a Diet Coke from the fridge. He opens it. Kramer
hears the hiss, and notices George.

KRAMER
(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
 
[Restaurant]
Jerry and Christie have just arrived. They're both wearing long coats,
Fastened to the collar.

JERRY
Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the
best in the city.
A member of staff approaches.

MAITRE D'
May I take your coat, miss?

CHRISTIE
Yes, thank you.
The Maitre d' helps Christie to slip out of her coat, revealing that
she has on the exact same dress as she was wearing in the antique store. Jerry
looks bemused, but plasters on a fixed smile as Christie looks at him.
 
[Monks']
Jerry and George sit in a booth, discussing the previous night. George
Fingers his chin thoughtfully.

GEORGE
The same outfit?

JERRY
The exact same outfit.

GEORGE
How many days was it between encounters.

JERRY
Three.

GEORGE
Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new
wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got
clean and she started all over again.

JERRY
Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at
the end of the cycle?

GEORGE
Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.

JERRY
Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?

GEORGE
Very curious.

JERRY
Indeed.

GEORGE
You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.

JERRY
Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.

GEORGE
(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.

JERRY
Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?

GEORGE
(standing) Not yet, but she's weakening.

JERRY
You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't
Destroy someone else's.

GEORGE
It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol.

JERRY
How about 'Mickey'?

GEORGE
'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!
George walks away, half-laughing at Jerry's ludicrous suggestion.
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is in the fridge. Kramer enters with a slide of the feet, and a
cigar in his mouth.

KRAMER
Hey buddy.

JERRY
(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the
fridge?

KRAMER
No, that's yours. My half is gone.

JERRY
What?

KRAMER
Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your
beef?

JERRY
You cannot buy half a can of soda.

KRAMER
Well, why not.

JERRY
Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation
with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?

KRAMER
Yeah.

JERRY
That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes
for this, okay...
Jerry holds up an apple, from which has been taken one large bite.

JERRY
...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought
the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
Jerry hold up a half banana.

KRAMER
Alright.

JERRY
...You bite it, you bought it.

KRAMER
Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.

JERRY
Thank you.

KRAMER
Yeah.
Elaine enters.

ELAINE
Hey.

KRAMER
Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?

ELAINE
Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even
know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.

KRAMER
(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.

ELAINE
No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like
saying,
you're hungry enough to eat a horse.

KRAMER
Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He
gets it from his butcher.

ELAINE
This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't
have the bike.

KRAMER
Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are
the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I
can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
Kramer holds one hand up above his head.

KRAMER
I always put you up here...
Kramer holds his other hand at about knee height.

KRAMER
...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
Kramer brings his first hand down to the level of the second. He
leaves, closing the door with a bang. Elaine sits, fighting with her conscience. There
is a brief pause, then the door opens again and Kramer pokes in his head,
expectantly.

ELAINE
(grudging) Alright.

KRAMER
(points) Digidi.
Kramer leaves and closes the door again.
 
[Restaurant]
George and Susan are having dinner.

GEORGE
Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody
else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.

SUSAN
Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.

GEORGE
Why not?

SUSAN
Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told
them the name, they just loved it.

GEORGE
So, what're you saying?

SUSAN
They're gonna name their baby Seven.

GEORGE
(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name,
I made it up!

SUSAN
I can't believe that they're using it.

GEORGE
(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose
all its cachet!

SUSAN
I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.

GEORGE
(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the
yin-yang!
 
[Elaine's Apartment]
Elaine is in bed. She begins to move to get up. As she raises herself
from the mattress, there is a loud crunching sound. A look of agony crosses her
face.

ELAINE
(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
 
[Street]
Elaine walks along the street. Her neck problem means she has her head
Tipped back so far she can't see directly in front of her. A guy coming the
other way gives her a warning.

MAN
Watch your step.
Elaine collides with a litter bin which is outside her field of vision.

ELAINE
(pain) Oh, ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer.
Christie is looking in a shop window, then she spots Elaine.

CHRISTIE
Excuse me. Elaine?
Elaine, handicapped by her neck, cannot see who's speaking.

ELAINE
Huh?
Christie comes over to Elaine. All Elaine can see of her is her head
and neck.

CHRISTIE
Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend,
right?

ELAINE
Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?

CHRISTIE
Yes. How y'doing?

ELAINE
(bearing up) I'm fine.

CHRISTIE
Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you.
Christie walks away.

ELAINE
(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
Kramer comes along the street, riding the Schwinn Stingray and ringing
the bell. He attracts comments from folk on the street.

VOICE 1 (O.C.)
Lookin' good.

VOICE 2 (O.C.)
Hey Cosmo, nice wheels.

KRAMER
You got that right!
A kid leans out the window of a parked Volvo.

KID
(scorn) Hey, you're riding a girl's bike.
Kramer thumbs his nose and continues pedalling.

ELAINE
(shouting) Kramer! Kramer!
 
[Outside Apartment Building]
George walks up to the door. He pushes the buzzer for a particular
apartment.

KEN (O.C.)
Hello.

GEORGE
Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry hears a loud knocking from the hallway.

ELAINE (O.C.)
(angry shout) Kramer!
Jerry opens the door to reveal Elaine hammering insistently at Kramer's
door.

ELAINE
Kramer!!

JERRY
Hey
Elaine turns to Jerry and gets a twinge from her neck.

ELAINE
Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
Elaine enters Jerry's apartment.

JERRY
Haven't seen him. How's the neck?

ELAINE
His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was
before.
Elaine removes her bag from her back, wincing from the pain as she
moves.

JERRY
Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a
knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.

ELAINE
Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the
antique store. What's her name, Christie?

JERRY
You saw her? What was she wearing?

ELAINE
I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of
my neck.

JERRY
Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?

ELAINE
What d'you care?

JERRY
Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
There's a ringing from the Schwinn's bell, and Kramer rides it into
Jerry's apartment. He rides all around the apartment, round the couch, past the
TV and is heading for the door.

ELAINE
Did you have a nice ride?

KRAMER
Oh, great ride.

ELAINE
Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
Elaine slams the door shut before Kramer can leave. Kramer rides
straight into the door with a clatter. He falls to the ground, then makes his
stumbling way upright again.

KRAMER
What're you talking about?! We had a deal!

ELAINE
(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck)
Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.

KRAMER
Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a
week.

ELAINE
What? You never told me that.

KRAMER
Well, it's common sense.

ELAINE
Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.

KRAMER
Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should
settle this.

ELAINE
Yeah Jerry.

JERRY
Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but
unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting
involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.

ELAINE
Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?

KRAMER
Alright, I'm down.

JERRY
Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story
before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose
heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of
any kind.
 
[Newman's Apartment]
Elaine and Kramer sit on Newman's couch. Elaine with her head tilted
back. Newman sits in his chair, his fingertips together, trying to give an
Impression of limitless wisdom.

ELAINE
So, that's the situation.

NEWMAN
Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly
has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one
rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is
all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages
who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels
into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...

KRAMER
Newman!
Newman catches himself, and comes back to normality.

NEWMAN
...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no
Matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?

KRAMER
Uh, yeah.

ELAINE
Yeah.

NEWMAN
Alright, let's begin.
Newman sits back, to begin his contemplation. There is the single
'ting' of a microwave.

NEWMAN
(excited) Ooh, my cocoa!
Newman leaps to his feet and heads for his kitchen.
 
[Ken and Carrie's Apartment]
Carrie is on the couch, with Ken sitting on the arm. George is
explaining about Seven.

KEN
Why can't we use Seven?

GEORGE
It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.

CARRIE
Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant. You've already postponed
The wedding. Who knows if you'll ever get married.

GEORGE
Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't
waffle!

KEN
Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name.
It's very unusual.

GEORGE
(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on
Soda.

KEN
(emphatic) Well, we don't care for Soda.

GEORGE
You don't care for Soda?!

CARRIE
(worked up) No, no. We don't like Soda at all!

GEORGE
(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's
refreshing!
Carrie jumps and gives a cry.

CARRIE
Oh!

KEN
What is it?

CARRIE
I felt something.

KEN
Are you okay, honey?

CARRIE
I think I'm going into labour.
George flashes a panicked expression.

KEN
Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the
hospital...
Ken and Carrie rise and head toward the door.

CARRIE
Okay.

KEN
...Alright? I got the suitcase packed, right here.
Ken grabs the suitcase from by the door and they exit, hurriedly.
George trails along behind them, making suggestions.

GEORGE
What about Six?
Ken gives him a look over his shoulder.

GEORGE
Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.
Ken has left, George follows out the door.

GEORGE
Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen!
George closes the door behind him.
 
[Restaurant]
Jerry and Christie are having dinner. Christie is eating, while Jerry
leans back picking at his meal, looking suspicious at the fact that Christie is
wearing the same black and white dress as at their two previous meetings.

CHRISTIE
Are you okay, Jerry? You seem quiet.

JERRY
No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.

CHRISTIE
I know exactly what you mean.

JERRY
Oh, I'm sure you do.
Christie begins to season her food, with salt. Jerry chews
thoughtfully.

JERRY (V.O.)
What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the
same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like
Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.
Christie adds a little pepper to her dish. But after replacing the
shaker, she knocks her glass of red wine over her dress.

CHRISTIE
(horrified) Oh my god!

JERRY
Oh.
Christie mops at the spill with her napkin, but there's only so much
you can do.

CHRISTIE
Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go
back to my apartment, so I can change?

JERRY
Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.
 
[Ken and Carrie's Car]
Ken is driving Carrie to the hospital. Carrie is as worked up as you'd
expect a woman in labor to be. In the back seat, George is making one last
attempt to save his name.

CARRIE
Are we almost there?

KEN
Just keep breathing, okay.

CARRIE
(deep breaths) Okay, okay.

KEN
Okay.

GEORGE
(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow
Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
As George speaks, Ken is looking impatient and angry.

KEN
Now's not the best time, George!

GEORGE
(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...

KEN
(firm) George! She's in labour!

GEORGE
(angry shout) So am I!
 
[Newman's Apartment]
Elaine and Kramer still sit on the couch, awaiting Newman's
arbitration.

NEWMAN
Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the
one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
Kramer looks at Elaine, thinking his arguments have put him one up.

NEWMAN
And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for
compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance
Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer.
Not for any man...
Kramer leans forward to receive the result. Elaine looks as attentive
as she can while only being able to look upwards.

NEWMAN
...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the
bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.

ELAINE
(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
Newman's face drops at her negative reaction. Kramer looks across at
the bike, looking worried.

ELAINE
Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing
in half.

KRAMER
No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another
than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.

ELAINE
Yeah, yeah, y-yeah.

NEWMAN
Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather
give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!

ELAINE
What?!

KRAMER
Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise.
Kramer picks up the bike and climbs aboard.

ELAINE
(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still
hurting me,
and now you have the bike?!

KRAMER
Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
Kramer opens the door and rides clumsily out, ringing the bell as he
goes.
 
[Christie's Apartment]
Christie leads Jerry into her home.

CHRISTIE
Here we are.

JERRY
(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
Christie puts down her bag, and removes her coat.

CHRISTIE
Well, I guess I'll go change.

JERRY
Yes, change. By all means, change.
Christie walks away down a hallway. Jerry removes his coat and sits
down. He looks around himself. On the coffee table he notices a small framed
picture of Christie and some guy. In the picture, she's wearing the same black and
White dress. Jerry picks it up and examines it more closely, reading a date
written on the photo.

JERRY (V.O.)
August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress!
She never
changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these
dresses.
Jerry gets up from his seat.

JERRY (V.O.)
There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
Jerry opens a closet and begins to look inside. While he's rooting
about in there, Christie reenters the room, wearing a robe and looking indignant
at discovering Jerry invading her privacy.

CHRISTIE
Ahem! Are you looking for something?

JERRY
What're you doing? I thought you were changing.

CHRISTIE
No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night.

JERRY
No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.

CHRISTIE
If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to
bed.
Jerry moves to the couch, where he half lays down.

JERRY
You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on
The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out
together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll
of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go
downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.

CHRISTIE
(unequivocal) Jerry. I don't think so.
Jerry picks up his coat and moves toward the door.

JERRY
You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?

CHRISTIE
(gesturing) Get out.
Jerry walks though the door. He's still talking as Christie closes it
on him.

JERRY
(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you
lay it out on the bed.
 
[Hospital]
Carrie is in a wheelchair, being wheeled by an orderly. She's doing her
breathing. Ken hurries alongside, comforting his wife. George also
hustles along the corridor with the group.

KEN
Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe.

GEORGE
(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It
would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!

CARRIE
(shouts) I'm having a baby!!
The orderly pushes the wheelchair on through the door of the delivery
room. Ken turns to face George.

KEN
George, you're not getting Seven! Now get outta here!!
Ken strides into the delivery room.

GEORGE
(desperate) Please! I have so little!
George tries to follow, but an orderly blocks his path.

ORDERLY
Sorry sir, it's family only.
The orderly closes the door on George, whose face can be seen through
The window.

GEORGE
I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
George thumps his fists against the door in frustration. He's crying as
He screams.

GEORGE
Seven!!
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is on the phone, while Kramer examines a box of cereal in the
kitchen.

JERRY
Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again?
(listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone.
C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can
bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me.
(hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
Defeated, Jerry hangs up the phone.

KRAMER
(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking
On these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.

JERRY
Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little
Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
Jerry tears a sheet off a writing pad, and presents it to Kramer.
Kramer takes a look.

KRAMER
(does a double take) Yikes.

JERRY
I know. Pretty steep.

KRAMER
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.

JERRY
Few do.

KRAMER
I'm good for it.

JERRY
Yeah, well, until this bill is paid...
Jerry takes back the tab, then takes the cereal out of Kramer's hands.

JERRY
...the food court is closed.

KRAMER
(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five
minutes. And, don't eat any more.
Kramer leaves at a run.
 
[Street]
Elaine is walking along, when she spots something ahead of her.

ELAINE
Hey, that's my bike!
Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn
for all he's worth. He rings the bell.

NEWMAN
Gangway!

ELAINE
This is my bike!
Newman brakes to a halt in front of Elaine.

NEWMAN
Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for
cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make
some minor modifications, you know. Solid tyres, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty
shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
Newman begins to ride away.

ELAINE
(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman,
gimme...
Elaine grabs hold of the trailing end of Newman's scarf.

NEWMAN
Hey!! Help me!
The show ends with a freeze frame of Newman on the bike, and a
determined Elaine grasping the scarf. There are sounds of a struggle.

[Nightclub]
Jerry's standup piece.

JERRY
I love it when people are complimented on something they're
wearing and they accept the compliment as if it was about them. "Nice tie." "Well,
thank you. Thank you very much." The compliment is for the tie, it's not for
you, but we take it. That's kind of the job of clothes; to get compliments for
us, because it's very hard to get compliments based on your human
qualities. Right? Let's face it, no matter how nice a person you are, nobody's gonna come
Say "Hey, nice person." It's much easier to be a bastard and just try and
match the colours up.
 
[Antique Toy Store]
Elaine and Jerry enter a store stocked with the toys of yesteryear.
They look around at the array of classic teddy bears, toy boats, puppets, etc.

ELAINE
(awed) Oh, look at this!

JERRY
Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
Something on the wall catches Elaine's eye. It's an old-fashioned
girl's bicycle, with high handlebars, a pink frame and a basket on the front.

ELAINE
(excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!
Jerry looks over, but his eye is drawn more towards an attractive
woman, Christie, who stands looking at the toys. She's wearing a dress of
mid-thigh length, black from the bottom of the ribs down, and white on the chest
and arms.

JERRY
(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.

ELAINE
(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's
model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
Christie leaves her examination of the toys on that side of the store,
and walks over to some other items. Jerry watches her as she goes, she notices
and smiles and flirtatious looks are exchanged. Jerry is oblivious to Elaine's
voice.

ELAINE
What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?

JERRY
(tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?

ELAINE
What d'you think?

JERRY
Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.

ELAINE
(laughs) I love it. I'm getting it.
Elaine reaches for the bike, as Jerry turns back to Christie.

ELAINE
Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.

CHRISTIE
I think your friend needs some help over there.

JERRY
You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
Elaine gives up on Jerry assisting her and tries to lift the bike off
the wall on her own. But as she raises it, the weight proves too much and she
falls backwards, ending up on her back on the floor with the bike pinning her
down. She struggles to lift it, but can't make much impression, so she rings
the bell on the bike. Jerry finally has his attention drawn away from Christie.

ELAINE
Hey!
Elaine makes 'So, are you gonna help me?' gestures.
 
[Restaurant]
George and Susan are having dinner with Ken and Carrie. Carrie is
Heavily pregnant. George is eating spaghetti with his usual decorum.

SUSAN
A little baby girl?

KEN
Doctor says it could be any day now.

GEORGE
(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are
cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what
does that make me?

CARRIE
Doesn't make you anything.

GEORGE
(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
George laughs and shovels another load of pasta into his mouth. Ken and
Carrie look perturbed.

SUSAN
So, have you picked out a name yet?

CARRIE
Well, we've narrowed it down to a few. We like Kimberley.

SUSAN
Aww.

GEORGE
(negative) Hu-ho, boy.

KEN
You don't like Kimberley?

GEORGE
Ech. What else you got?

KEN
How about Joan?

GEORGE
Aw c'mon, I'm eating here.

SUSAN
(warning) George!

CARRIE
Pamela?

GEORGE
Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people,
I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.

KEN
What?

GEORGE
Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.

CARRIE
I don't know, it sounds a little strange.

GEORGE
All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you
Telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?

KEN
Yeah, but uh... Soda?

GEORGE
Yeah, that's right. It's working.

CARRIE
We'll put it on the list.

GEORGE
I solve problems. That's just what I do.
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry sits in front of the TV, while in the kitchen Kramer is building
A sandwich of epic proportions. He hums to himself as he piles sliced
meat onto bread. Jerry looks over at him, looking somewhat irritated by the way
Kramer's demolishing his food stocks.

KRAMER
(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.

JERRY
You're really going to town with that turkey there.

KRAMER
Oh yeah, I got a big appetite.
Kramer goes to the fridge and looks inside.

KRAMER
Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.

JERRY
It's on the door.

KRAMER
(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff?
No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
Kramer waves away the squeezy option and shuts the fridge.

KRAMER
Ah, 's no good.
Kramer goes back to his sandwich, puts the second slice of bread on,
and takes a bite. It doesn't meet with his approval. He spits out the mouthful he's
taken onto the plate, and dumps the rest of the sandwich next to it.

KRAMER
No. That's bush league.
Kramer heads toward the door.

JERRY
Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there?
That's like half a pound of turkey!

KRAMER
No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without
Dijon.

JERRY
(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your
favourites on hand.

KRAMER
Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy
with our arrangement?

JERRY
What arrangement?

KRAMER
Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I
Wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.

JERRY
(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there
and I will.
Elaine enters. She has her head leaning over to the left, and she's
Moving carefully, like it's giving her pain.

KRAMER
Oh, hey.

ELAINE
Hey.

JERRY
Hey. What's with your neck?

ELAINE
Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall.
(pointedly) By myself.

JERRY
Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.

ELAINE
(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.

JERRY
Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.

ELAINE
Ach, maybe.

JERRY
Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.

ELAINE
I don't know.

JERRY
Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned
it...

ELAINE
(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the
hell up?

JERRY
Awright.

ELAINE
God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike
to the first person who could make this pain go away.

KRAMER
Aw, you really hurting, huh?

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.

KRAMER
Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted.
Kramer walks around behind the seated Elaine, and reaches for her neck.

KRAMER
Alright, lean forward, relax.

ELAINE
(worried) What? What?

KRAMER
Encounter shiatsu.
Kramer begins to work at Elaine's neck with his thumbs.

ELAINE
Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?

KRAMER
(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the
Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.

ELAINE
Ah hah.

KRAMER
(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.

ELAINE
(seriously worried) Wha...?

KRAMER
He's a genius. Here we go...
Kramer takes a firm grip of each side of Elaine's head. Elaine looks
Really worried now. She grabs a hold of Jerry's shirt and the arm of the
couch, and her feet stamp on the floor.

KRAMER
From pain, will come pleasure.
Kramer violently twists Elaine's head to the left. There's a loud
Crunching sound, and Elaine cries out in shock. Kramer lets go of her head and
steps away, job done.

KRAMER
Uh? Voila.

ELAINE
(pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!

KRAMER
Yeah.
Elaine rolls her head around, completely comfortable.

ELAINE
Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!

JERRY
What's even more amazing is his formal training is in
paediatrics.

KRAMER
Awright, my work is done here.
Kramer heads for the door.

ELAINE
(big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!

KRAMER
(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.

ELAINE
(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?

JERRY
I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to
anyone who fixes your neck.

ELAINE
You really think he wants the bike?

JERRY
Oh yeah.

ELAINE
It took him like ten seconds!

JERRY
Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
 
[George's Car]
George and Susan, heading home from the restaurant. George is happy,
smiling and whistling.

GEORGE
I think they really went for that Soda.

SUSAN
What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring
you.

GEORGE
Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.

SUSAN
I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.

GEORGE
Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A
Real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?

SUSAN
Yeah.
George uses his finger to draw a number 7 in the air, accompanying the
Strokes of his digit with a two-tone whistle.

SUSAN
What is that? Sign language?

GEORGE
No, Seven.

SUSAN
Seven Costanza? You're serious?

GEORGE
Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
Susan scoffs.

GEORGE
...especially a girl. Or a boy.

SUSAN
I don't think so.

GEORGE
What, you don't like the name?

SUSAN
It's not a name. It's a number.

GEORGE
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all
Around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.

SUSAN
It's awful. I hate it!

GEORGE
(angry) Well, that's the name!

SUSAN
(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to
be named Seven!

GEORGE
(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all
crazy on me!
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry walks from the bathroom, talking to George, who's just told him
about his contretemps with Susan.

JERRY
Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of
school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually
seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.

GEORGE
(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name
than Seven.
Jerry walks toward the kitchen. He sees an item on the counter.

JERRY
Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug
Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup?
Pretty name for a girl.

GEORGE
Alright, you having a good time there?
Jerry is in the kitchen, and opens a cupboard. His eyes run over the
array of good within.

JERRY
I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik?
Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.

GEORGE
(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me,
Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
Jerry comes back into the living room. A thought occurs.

JERRY
Oh, I forgot to call Christie.

GEORGE
Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?

JERRY
Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop
neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.

GEORGE
And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do
it!

JERRY
(smug) I'm not engaged.
George gives Jerry a look. Kramer enters. He's carrying a small
goldfish bowl, a pad and a pencil tied to the bowl by string.

KRAMER
Ah, I got it.

JERRY
Got what?

KRAMER
(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry.
Refrigerator problem, is solved.

JERRY
Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.

KRAMER
Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I
want.
Kramer takes a cupcake from a box on the counter.

KRAMER
Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I
put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the
bowl) There. Very simple.

JERRY
Sort of a mooching inventory.

KRAMER
No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em
all up, and you give me the bill.

JERRY
Alright.

KRAMER
Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When
Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
George passes by as he goes to the fridge.

JERRY
Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.

KRAMER
Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other
at our word, all is lost.
George has fetched a Diet Coke from the fridge. He opens it. Kramer
hears the hiss, and notices George.

KRAMER
(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
 
[Restaurant]
Jerry and Christie have just arrived. They're both wearing long coats,
Fastened to the collar.

JERRY
Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the
best in the city.
A member of staff approaches.

MAITRE D'
May I take your coat, miss?

CHRISTIE
Yes, thank you.
The Maitre d' helps Christie to slip out of her coat, revealing that
she has on the exact same dress as she was wearing in the antique store. Jerry
looks bemused, but plasters on a fixed smile as Christie looks at him.
 
[Monks']
Jerry and George sit in a booth, discussing the previous night. George
Fingers his chin thoughtfully.

GEORGE
The same outfit?

JERRY
The exact same outfit.

GEORGE
How many days was it between encounters.

JERRY
Three.

GEORGE
Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new
wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got
clean and she started all over again.

JERRY
Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at
the end of the cycle?

GEORGE
Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.

JERRY
Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?

GEORGE
Very curious.

JERRY
Indeed.

GEORGE
You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.

JERRY
Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.

GEORGE
(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.

JERRY
Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?

GEORGE
(standing) Not yet, but she's weakening.

JERRY
You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't
Destroy someone else's.

GEORGE
It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol.

JERRY
How about 'Mickey'?

GEORGE
'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!
George walks away, half-laughing at Jerry's ludicrous suggestion.
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is in the fridge. Kramer enters with a slide of the feet, and a
cigar in his mouth.

KRAMER
Hey buddy.

JERRY
(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the
fridge?

KRAMER
No, that's yours. My half is gone.

JERRY
What?

KRAMER
Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your
beef?

JERRY
You cannot buy half a can of soda.

KRAMER
Well, why not.

JERRY
Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation
with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?

KRAMER
Yeah.

JERRY
That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes
for this, okay...
Jerry holds up an apple, from which has been taken one large bite.

JERRY
...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought
the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
Jerry hold up a half banana.

KRAMER
Alright.

JERRY
...You bite it, you bought it.

KRAMER
Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.

JERRY
Thank you.

KRAMER
Yeah.
Elaine enters.

ELAINE
Hey.

KRAMER
Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?

ELAINE
Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even
know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.

KRAMER
(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.

ELAINE
No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like
saying,
you're hungry enough to eat a horse.

KRAMER
Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He
gets it from his butcher.

ELAINE
This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't
have the bike.

KRAMER
Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are
the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I
can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
Kramer holds one hand up above his head.

KRAMER
I always put you up here...
Kramer holds his other hand at about knee height.

KRAMER
...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
Kramer brings his first hand down to the level of the second. He
leaves, closing the door with a bang. Elaine sits, fighting with her conscience. There
is a brief pause, then the door opens again and Kramer pokes in his head,
expectantly.

ELAINE
(grudging) Alright.

KRAMER
(points) Digidi.
Kramer leaves and closes the door again.
 
[Restaurant]
George and Susan are having dinner.

GEORGE
Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody
else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.

SUSAN
Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.

GEORGE
Why not?

SUSAN
Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told
them the name, they just loved it.

GEORGE
So, what're you saying?

SUSAN
They're gonna name their baby Seven.

GEORGE
(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name,
I made it up!

SUSAN
I can't believe that they're using it.

GEORGE
(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose
all its cachet!

SUSAN
I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.

GEORGE
(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the
yin-yang!
 
[Elaine's Apartment]
Elaine is in bed. She begins to move to get up. As she raises herself
from the mattress, there is a loud crunching sound. A look of agony crosses her
face.

ELAINE
(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
 
[Street]
Elaine walks along the street. Her neck problem means she has her head
Tipped back so far she can't see directly in front of her. A guy coming the
other way gives her a warning.

MAN
Watch your step.
Elaine collides with a litter bin which is outside her field of vision.

ELAINE
(pain) Oh, ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer.
Christie is looking in a shop window, then she spots Elaine.

CHRISTIE
Excuse me. Elaine?
Elaine, handicapped by her neck, cannot see who's speaking.

ELAINE
Huh?
Christie comes over to Elaine. All Elaine can see of her is her head
and neck.

CHRISTIE
Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend,
right?

ELAINE
Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?

CHRISTIE
Yes. How y'doing?

ELAINE
(bearing up) I'm fine.

CHRISTIE
Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you.
Christie walks away.

ELAINE
(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
Kramer comes along the street, riding the Schwinn Stingray and ringing
the bell. He attracts comments from folk on the street.

VOICE 1 (O.C.)
Lookin' good.

VOICE 2 (O.C.)
Hey Cosmo, nice wheels.

KRAMER
You got that right!
A kid leans out the window of a parked Volvo.

KID
(scorn) Hey, you're riding a girl's bike.
Kramer thumbs his nose and continues pedalling.

ELAINE
(shouting) Kramer! Kramer!
 
[Outside Apartment Building]
George walks up to the door. He pushes the buzzer for a particular
apartment.

KEN (O.C.)
Hello.

GEORGE
Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry hears a loud knocking from the hallway.

ELAINE (O.C.)
(angry shout) Kramer!
Jerry opens the door to reveal Elaine hammering insistently at Kramer's
door.

ELAINE
Kramer!!

JERRY
Hey
Elaine turns to Jerry and gets a twinge from her neck.

ELAINE
Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
Elaine enters Jerry's apartment.

JERRY
Haven't seen him. How's the neck?

ELAINE
His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was
before.
Elaine removes her bag from her back, wincing from the pain as she
moves.

JERRY
Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a
knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.

ELAINE
Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the
antique store. What's her name, Christie?

JERRY
You saw her? What was she wearing?

ELAINE
I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of
my neck.

JERRY
Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?

ELAINE
What d'you care?

JERRY
Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
There's a ringing from the Schwinn's bell, and Kramer rides it into
Jerry's apartment. He rides all around the apartment, round the couch, past the
TV and is heading for the door.

ELAINE
Did you have a nice ride?

KRAMER
Oh, great ride.

ELAINE
Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
Elaine slams the door shut before Kramer can leave. Kramer rides
straight into the door with a clatter. He falls to the ground, then makes his
stumbling way upright again.

KRAMER
What're you talking about?! We had a deal!

ELAINE
(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck)
Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.

KRAMER
Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a
week.

ELAINE
What? You never told me that.

KRAMER
Well, it's common sense.

ELAINE
Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.

KRAMER
Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should
settle this.

ELAINE
Yeah Jerry.

JERRY
Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but
unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting
involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.

ELAINE
Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?

KRAMER
Alright, I'm down.

JERRY
Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story
before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose
heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of
any kind.
 
[Newman's Apartment]
Elaine and Kramer sit on Newman's couch. Elaine with her head tilted
back. Newman sits in his chair, his fingertips together, trying to give an
Impression of limitless wisdom.

ELAINE
So, that's the situation.

NEWMAN
Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly
has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one
rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is
all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages
who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels
into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...

KRAMER
Newman!
Newman catches himself, and comes back to normality.

NEWMAN
...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no
Matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?

KRAMER
Uh, yeah.

ELAINE
Yeah.

NEWMAN
Alright, let's begin.
Newman sits back, to begin his contemplation. There is the single
'ting' of a microwave.

NEWMAN
(excited) Ooh, my cocoa!
Newman leaps to his feet and heads for his kitchen.
 
[Ken and Carrie's Apartment]
Carrie is on the couch, with Ken sitting on the arm. George is
explaining about Seven.

KEN
Why can't we use Seven?

GEORGE
It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.

CARRIE
Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant. You've already postponed
The wedding. Who knows if you'll ever get married.

GEORGE
Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't
waffle!

KEN
Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name.
It's very unusual.

GEORGE
(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on
Soda.

KEN
(emphatic) Well, we don't care for Soda.

GEORGE
You don't care for Soda?!

CARRIE
(worked up) No, no. We don't like Soda at all!

GEORGE
(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's
refreshing!
Carrie jumps and gives a cry.

CARRIE
Oh!

KEN
What is it?

CARRIE
I felt something.

KEN
Are you okay, honey?

CARRIE
I think I'm going into labour.
George flashes a panicked expression.

KEN
Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the
hospital...
Ken and Carrie rise and head toward the door.

CARRIE
Okay.

KEN
...Alright? I got the suitcase packed, right here.
Ken grabs the suitcase from by the door and they exit, hurriedly.
George trails along behind them, making suggestions.

GEORGE
What about Six?
Ken gives him a look over his shoulder.

GEORGE
Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.
Ken has left, George follows out the door.

GEORGE
Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen!
George closes the door behind him.
 
[Restaurant]
Jerry and Christie are having dinner. Christie is eating, while Jerry
leans back picking at his meal, looking suspicious at the fact that Christie is
wearing the same black and white dress as at their two previous meetings.

CHRISTIE
Are you okay, Jerry? You seem quiet.

JERRY
No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.

CHRISTIE
I know exactly what you mean.

JERRY
Oh, I'm sure you do.
Christie begins to season her food, with salt. Jerry chews
thoughtfully.

JERRY (V.O.)
What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the
same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like
Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.
Christie adds a little pepper to her dish. But after replacing the
shaker, she knocks her glass of red wine over her dress.

CHRISTIE
(horrified) Oh my god!

JERRY
Oh.
Christie mops at the spill with her napkin, but there's only so much
you can do.

CHRISTIE
Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go
back to my apartment, so I can change?

JERRY
Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.
 
[Ken and Carrie's Car]
Ken is driving Carrie to the hospital. Carrie is as worked up as you'd
expect a woman in labor to be. In the back seat, George is making one last
attempt to save his name.

CARRIE
Are we almost there?

KEN
Just keep breathing, okay.

CARRIE
(deep breaths) Okay, okay.

KEN
Okay.

GEORGE
(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow
Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
As George speaks, Ken is looking impatient and angry.

KEN
Now's not the best time, George!

GEORGE
(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...

KEN
(firm) George! She's in labour!

GEORGE
(angry shout) So am I!
 
[Newman's Apartment]
Elaine and Kramer still sit on the couch, awaiting Newman's
arbitration.

NEWMAN
Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the
one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
Kramer looks at Elaine, thinking his arguments have put him one up.

NEWMAN
And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for
compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance
Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer.
Not for any man...
Kramer leans forward to receive the result. Elaine looks as attentive
as she can while only being able to look upwards.

NEWMAN
...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the
bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.

ELAINE
(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
Newman's face drops at her negative reaction. Kramer looks across at
the bike, looking worried.

ELAINE
Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing
in half.

KRAMER
No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another
than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.

ELAINE
Yeah, yeah, y-yeah.

NEWMAN
Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather
give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!

ELAINE
What?!

KRAMER
Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise.
Kramer picks up the bike and climbs aboard.

ELAINE
(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still
hurting me,
and now you have the bike?!

KRAMER
Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
Kramer opens the door and rides clumsily out, ringing the bell as he
goes.
 
[Christie's Apartment]
Christie leads Jerry into her home.

CHRISTIE
Here we are.

JERRY
(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
Christie puts down her bag, and removes her coat.

CHRISTIE
Well, I guess I'll go change.

JERRY
Yes, change. By all means, change.
Christie walks away down a hallway. Jerry removes his coat and sits
down. He looks around himself. On the coffee table he notices a small framed
picture of Christie and some guy. In the picture, she's wearing the same black and
White dress. Jerry picks it up and examines it more closely, reading a date
written on the photo.

JERRY (V.O.)
August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress!
She never
changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these
dresses.
Jerry gets up from his seat.

JERRY (V.O.)
There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
Jerry opens a closet and begins to look inside. While he's rooting
about in there, Christie reenters the room, wearing a robe and looking indignant
at discovering Jerry invading her privacy.

CHRISTIE
Ahem! Are you looking for something?

JERRY
What're you doing? I thought you were changing.

CHRISTIE
No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night.

JERRY
No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.

CHRISTIE
If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to
bed.
Jerry moves to the couch, where he half lays down.

JERRY
You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on
The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out
together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll
of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go
downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.

CHRISTIE
(unequivocal) Jerry. I don't think so.
Jerry picks up his coat and moves toward the door.

JERRY
You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?

CHRISTIE
(gesturing) Get out.
Jerry walks though the door. He's still talking as Christie closes it
on him.

JERRY
(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you
lay it out on the bed.
 
[Hospital]
Carrie is in a wheelchair, being wheeled by an orderly. She's doing her
breathing. Ken hurries alongside, comforting his wife. George also
hustles along the corridor with the group.

KEN
Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe.

GEORGE
(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It
would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!

CARRIE
(shouts) I'm having a baby!!
The orderly pushes the wheelchair on through the door of the delivery
room. Ken turns to face George.

KEN
George, you're not getting Seven! Now get outta here!!
Ken strides into the delivery room.

GEORGE
(desperate) Please! I have so little!
George tries to follow, but an orderly blocks his path.

ORDERLY
Sorry sir, it's family only.
The orderly closes the door on George, whose face can be seen through
The window.

GEORGE
I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
George thumps his fists against the door in frustration. He's crying as
He screams.

GEORGE
Seven!!
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is on the phone, while Kramer examines a box of cereal in the
kitchen.

JERRY
Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again?
(listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone.
C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can
bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me.
(hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
Defeated, Jerry hangs up the phone.

KRAMER
(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking
On these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.

JERRY
Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little
Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
Jerry tears a sheet off a writing pad, and presents it to Kramer.
Kramer takes a look.

KRAMER
(does a double take) Yikes.

JERRY
I know. Pretty steep.

KRAMER
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.

JERRY
Few do.

KRAMER
I'm good for it.

JERRY
Yeah, well, until this bill is paid...
Jerry takes back the tab, then takes the cereal out of Kramer's hands.

JERRY
...the food court is closed.

KRAMER
(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five
minutes. And, don't eat any more.
Kramer leaves at a run.
 
[Street]
Elaine is walking along, when she spots something ahead of her.

ELAINE
Hey, that's my bike!
Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn
for all he's worth. He rings the bell.

NEWMAN
Gangway!

ELAINE
This is my bike!
Newman brakes to a halt in front of Elaine.

NEWMAN
Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for
cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make
some minor modifications, you know. Solid tyres, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty
shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
Newman begins to ride away.

ELAINE
(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman,
gimme...
Elaine grabs hold of the trailing end of Newman's scarf.

NEWMAN
Hey!! Help me!
The show ends with a freeze frame of Newman on the bike, and a
determined Elaine grasping the scarf. There are sounds of a struggle.

[Nightclub]
Jerry's standup piece.

JERRY
I love it when people are complimented on something they're
wearing and they accept the compliment as if it was about them. "Nice tie." "Well,
thank you. Thank you very much." The compliment is for the tie, it's not for
you, but we take it. That's kind of the job of clothes; to get compliments for
us, because it's very hard to get compliments based on your human
qualities. Right? Let's face it, no matter how nice a person you are, nobody's gonna come
Say "Hey, nice person." It's much easier to be a bastard and just try and
match the colours up.
 
[Antique Toy Store]
Elaine and Jerry enter a store stocked with the toys of yesteryear.
They look around at the array of classic teddy bears, toy boats, puppets, etc.

ELAINE
(awed) Oh, look at this!

JERRY
Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
Something on the wall catches Elaine's eye. It's an old-fashioned
girl's bicycle, with high handlebars, a pink frame and a basket on the front.

ELAINE
(excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!
Jerry looks over, but his eye is drawn more towards an attractive
woman, Christie, who stands looking at the toys. She's wearing a dress of
mid-thigh length, black from the bottom of the ribs down, and white on the chest
and arms.

JERRY
(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.

ELAINE
(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's
model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
Christie leaves her examination of the toys on that side of the store,
and walks over to some other items. Jerry watches her as she goes, she notices
and smiles and flirtatious looks are exchanged. Jerry is oblivious to Elaine's
voice.

ELAINE
What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?

JERRY
(tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?

ELAINE
What d'you think?

JERRY
Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.

ELAINE
(laughs) I love it. I'm getting it.
Elaine reaches for the bike, as Jerry turns back to Christie.

ELAINE
Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.

CHRISTIE
I think your friend needs some help over there.

JERRY
You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
Elaine gives up on Jerry assisting her and tries to lift the bike off
the wall on her own. But as she raises it, the weight proves too much and she
falls backwards, ending up on her back on the floor with the bike pinning her
down. She struggles to lift it, but can't make much impression, so she rings
the bell on the bike. Jerry finally has his attention drawn away from Christie.

ELAINE
Hey!
Elaine makes 'So, are you gonna help me?' gestures.
 
[Restaurant]
George and Susan are having dinner with Ken and Carrie. Carrie is
Heavily pregnant. George is eating spaghetti with his usual decorum.

SUSAN
A little baby girl?

KEN
Doctor says it could be any day now.

GEORGE
(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are
cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what
does that make me?

CARRIE
Doesn't make you anything.

GEORGE
(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
George laughs and shovels another load of pasta into his mouth. Ken and
Carrie look perturbed.

SUSAN
So, have you picked out a name yet?

CARRIE
Well, we've narrowed it down to a few. We like Kimberley.

SUSAN
Aww.

GEORGE
(negative) Hu-ho, boy.

KEN
You don't like Kimberley?

GEORGE
Ech. What else you got?

KEN
How about Joan?

GEORGE
Aw c'mon, I'm eating here.

SUSAN
(warning) George!

CARRIE
Pamela?

GEORGE
Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people,
I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.

KEN
What?

GEORGE
Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.

CARRIE
I don't know, it sounds a little strange.

GEORGE
All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you
Telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?

KEN
Yeah, but uh... Soda?

GEORGE
Yeah, that's right. It's working.

CARRIE
We'll put it on the list.

GEORGE
I solve problems. That's just what I do.
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry sits in front of the TV, while in the kitchen Kramer is building
A sandwich of epic proportions. He hums to himself as he piles sliced
meat onto bread. Jerry looks over at him, looking somewhat irritated by the way
Kramer's demolishing his food stocks.

KRAMER
(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.

JERRY
You're really going to town with that turkey there.

KRAMER
Oh yeah, I got a big appetite.
Kramer goes to the fridge and looks inside.

KRAMER
Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.

JERRY
It's on the door.

KRAMER
(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff?
No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
Kramer waves away the squeezy option and shuts the fridge.

KRAMER
Ah, 's no good.
Kramer goes back to his sandwich, puts the second slice of bread on,
and takes a bite. It doesn't meet with his approval. He spits out the mouthful he's
taken onto the plate, and dumps the rest of the sandwich next to it.

KRAMER
No. That's bush league.
Kramer heads toward the door.

JERRY
Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there?
That's like half a pound of turkey!

KRAMER
No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without
Dijon.

JERRY
(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your
favourites on hand.

KRAMER
Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy
with our arrangement?

JERRY
What arrangement?

KRAMER
Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I
Wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.

JERRY
(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there
and I will.
Elaine enters. She has her head leaning over to the left, and she's
Moving carefully, like it's giving her pain.

KRAMER
Oh, hey.

ELAINE
Hey.

JERRY
Hey. What's with your neck?

ELAINE
Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall.
(pointedly) By myself.

JERRY
Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.

ELAINE
(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.

JERRY
Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.

ELAINE
Ach, maybe.

JERRY
Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.

ELAINE
I don't know.

JERRY
Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned
it...

ELAINE
(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the
hell up?

JERRY
Awright.

ELAINE
God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike
to the first person who could make this pain go away.

KRAMER
Aw, you really hurting, huh?

ELAINE
Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.

KRAMER
Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted.
Kramer walks around behind the seated Elaine, and reaches for her neck.

KRAMER
Alright, lean forward, relax.

ELAINE
(worried) What? What?

KRAMER
Encounter shiatsu.
Kramer begins to work at Elaine's neck with his thumbs.

ELAINE
Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?

KRAMER
(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the
Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.

ELAINE
Ah hah.

KRAMER
(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.

ELAINE
(seriously worried) Wha...?

KRAMER
He's a genius. Here we go...
Kramer takes a firm grip of each side of Elaine's head. Elaine looks
Really worried now. She grabs a hold of Jerry's shirt and the arm of the
couch, and her feet stamp on the floor.

KRAMER
From pain, will come pleasure.
Kramer violently twists Elaine's head to the left. There's a loud
Crunching sound, and Elaine cries out in shock. Kramer lets go of her head and
steps away, job done.

KRAMER
Uh? Voila.

ELAINE
(pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!

KRAMER
Yeah.
Elaine rolls her head around, completely comfortable.

ELAINE
Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!

JERRY
What's even more amazing is his formal training is in
paediatrics.

KRAMER
Awright, my work is done here.
Kramer heads for the door.

ELAINE
(big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!

KRAMER
(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.

ELAINE
(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?

JERRY
I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to
anyone who fixes your neck.

ELAINE
You really think he wants the bike?

JERRY
Oh yeah.

ELAINE
It took him like ten seconds!

JERRY
Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
 
[George's Car]
George and Susan, heading home from the restaurant. George is happy,
smiling and whistling.

GEORGE
I think they really went for that Soda.

SUSAN
What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring
you.

GEORGE
Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.

SUSAN
I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda.

GEORGE
Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A
Real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?

SUSAN
Yeah.
George uses his finger to draw a number 7 in the air, accompanying the
Strokes of his digit with a two-tone whistle.

SUSAN
What is that? Sign language?

GEORGE
No, Seven.

SUSAN
Seven Costanza? You're serious?

GEORGE
Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
Susan scoffs.

GEORGE
...especially a girl. Or a boy.

SUSAN
I don't think so.

GEORGE
What, you don't like the name?

SUSAN
It's not a name. It's a number.

GEORGE
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all
Around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.

SUSAN
It's awful. I hate it!

GEORGE
(angry) Well, that's the name!

SUSAN
(also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to
be named Seven!

GEORGE
(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all
crazy on me!
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry walks from the bathroom, talking to George, who's just told him
about his contretemps with Susan.

JERRY
Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of
school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually
seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.

GEORGE
(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name
than Seven.
Jerry walks toward the kitchen. He sees an item on the counter.

JERRY
Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug
Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup?
Pretty name for a girl.

GEORGE
Alright, you having a good time there?
Jerry is in the kitchen, and opens a cupboard. His eyes run over the
array of good within.

JERRY
I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik?
Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.

GEORGE
(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me,
Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
Jerry comes back into the living room. A thought occurs.

JERRY
Oh, I forgot to call Christie.

GEORGE
Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?

JERRY
Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop
neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.

GEORGE
And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do
it!

JERRY
(smug) I'm not engaged.
George gives Jerry a look. Kramer enters. He's carrying a small
goldfish bowl, a pad and a pencil tied to the bowl by string.

KRAMER
Ah, I got it.

JERRY
Got what?

KRAMER
(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry.
Refrigerator problem, is solved.

JERRY
Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.

KRAMER
Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I
want.
Kramer takes a cupcake from a box on the counter.

KRAMER
Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I
put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the
bowl) There. Very simple.

JERRY
Sort of a mooching inventory.

KRAMER
No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em
all up, and you give me the bill.

JERRY
Alright.

KRAMER
Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When
Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
George passes by as he goes to the fridge.

JERRY
Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.

KRAMER
Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other
at our word, all is lost.
George has fetched a Diet Coke from the fridge. He opens it. Kramer
hears the hiss, and notices George.

KRAMER
(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
 
[Restaurant]
Jerry and Christie have just arrived. They're both wearing long coats,
Fastened to the collar.

JERRY
Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the
best in the city.
A member of staff approaches.

MAITRE D'
May I take your coat, miss?

CHRISTIE
Yes, thank you.
The Maitre d' helps Christie to slip out of her coat, revealing that
she has on the exact same dress as she was wearing in the antique store. Jerry
looks bemused, but plasters on a fixed smile as Christie looks at him.
 
[Monks']
Jerry and George sit in a booth, discussing the previous night. George
Fingers his chin thoughtfully.

GEORGE
The same outfit?

JERRY
The exact same outfit.

GEORGE
How many days was it between encounters.

JERRY
Three.

GEORGE
Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new
wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got
clean and she started all over again.

JERRY
Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at
the end of the cycle?

GEORGE
Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.

JERRY
Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?

GEORGE
Very curious.

JERRY
Indeed.

GEORGE
You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.

JERRY
Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.

GEORGE
(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.

JERRY
Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?

GEORGE
(standing) Not yet, but she's weakening.

JERRY
You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't
Destroy someone else's.

GEORGE
It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol.

JERRY
How about 'Mickey'?

GEORGE
'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!
George walks away, half-laughing at Jerry's ludicrous suggestion.
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is in the fridge. Kramer enters with a slide of the feet, and a
cigar in his mouth.

KRAMER
Hey buddy.

JERRY
(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the
fridge?

KRAMER
No, that's yours. My half is gone.

JERRY
What?

KRAMER
Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your
beef?

JERRY
You cannot buy half a can of soda.

KRAMER
Well, why not.

JERRY
Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation
with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?

KRAMER
Yeah.

JERRY
That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes
for this, okay...
Jerry holds up an apple, from which has been taken one large bite.

JERRY
...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought
the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
Jerry hold up a half banana.

KRAMER
Alright.

JERRY
...You bite it, you bought it.

KRAMER
Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.

JERRY
Thank you.

KRAMER
Yeah.
Elaine enters.

ELAINE
Hey.

KRAMER
Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?

ELAINE
Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even
know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.

KRAMER
(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.

ELAINE
No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like
saying,
you're hungry enough to eat a horse.

KRAMER
Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He
gets it from his butcher.

ELAINE
This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't
have the bike.

KRAMER
Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are
the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I
can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
Kramer holds one hand up above his head.

KRAMER
I always put you up here...
Kramer holds his other hand at about knee height.

KRAMER
...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
Kramer brings his first hand down to the level of the second. He
leaves, closing the door with a bang. Elaine sits, fighting with her conscience. There
is a brief pause, then the door opens again and Kramer pokes in his head,
expectantly.

ELAINE
(grudging) Alright.

KRAMER
(points) Digidi.
Kramer leaves and closes the door again.
 
[Restaurant]
George and Susan are having dinner.

GEORGE
Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody
else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.

SUSAN
Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more.

GEORGE
Why not?

SUSAN
Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told
them the name, they just loved it.

GEORGE
So, what're you saying?

SUSAN
They're gonna name their baby Seven.

GEORGE
(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name,
I made it up!

SUSAN
I can't believe that they're using it.

GEORGE
(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose
all its cachet!

SUSAN
I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.

GEORGE
(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the
yin-yang!
 
[Elaine's Apartment]
Elaine is in bed. She begins to move to get up. As she raises herself
from the mattress, there is a loud crunching sound. A look of agony crosses her
face.

ELAINE
(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
 
[Street]
Elaine walks along the street. Her neck problem means she has her head
Tipped back so far she can't see directly in front of her. A guy coming the
other way gives her a warning.

MAN
Watch your step.
Elaine collides with a litter bin which is outside her field of vision.

ELAINE
(pain) Oh, ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer.
Christie is looking in a shop window, then she spots Elaine.

CHRISTIE
Excuse me. Elaine?
Elaine, handicapped by her neck, cannot see who's speaking.

ELAINE
Huh?
Christie comes over to Elaine. All Elaine can see of her is her head
and neck.

CHRISTIE
Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend,
right?

ELAINE
Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?

CHRISTIE
Yes. How y'doing?

ELAINE
(bearing up) I'm fine.

CHRISTIE
Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you.
Christie walks away.

ELAINE
(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
Kramer comes along the street, riding the Schwinn Stingray and ringing
the bell. He attracts comments from folk on the street.

VOICE 1 (O.C.)
Lookin' good.

VOICE 2 (O.C.)
Hey Cosmo, nice wheels.

KRAMER
You got that right!
A kid leans out the window of a parked Volvo.

KID
(scorn) Hey, you're riding a girl's bike.
Kramer thumbs his nose and continues pedalling.

ELAINE
(shouting) Kramer! Kramer!
 
[Outside Apartment Building]
George walks up to the door. He pushes the buzzer for a particular
apartment.

KEN (O.C.)
Hello.

GEORGE
Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry hears a loud knocking from the hallway.

ELAINE (O.C.)
(angry shout) Kramer!
Jerry opens the door to reveal Elaine hammering insistently at Kramer's
door.

ELAINE
Kramer!!

JERRY
Hey
Elaine turns to Jerry and gets a twinge from her neck.

ELAINE
Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
Elaine enters Jerry's apartment.

JERRY
Haven't seen him. How's the neck?

ELAINE
His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was
before.
Elaine removes her bag from her back, wincing from the pain as she
moves.

JERRY
Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a
knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.

ELAINE
Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the
antique store. What's her name, Christie?

JERRY
You saw her? What was she wearing?

ELAINE
I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of
my neck.

JERRY
Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?

ELAINE
What d'you care?

JERRY
Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
There's a ringing from the Schwinn's bell, and Kramer rides it into
Jerry's apartment. He rides all around the apartment, round the couch, past the
TV and is heading for the door.

ELAINE
Did you have a nice ride?

KRAMER
Oh, great ride.

ELAINE
Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
Elaine slams the door shut before Kramer can leave. Kramer rides
straight into the door with a clatter. He falls to the ground, then makes his
stumbling way upright again.

KRAMER
What're you talking about?! We had a deal!

ELAINE
(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck)
Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.

KRAMER
Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a
week.

ELAINE
What? You never told me that.

KRAMER
Well, it's common sense.

ELAINE
Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.

KRAMER
Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should
settle this.

ELAINE
Yeah Jerry.

JERRY
Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but
unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting
involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.

ELAINE
Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?

KRAMER
Alright, I'm down.

JERRY
Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story
before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose
heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of
any kind.
 
[Newman's Apartment]
Elaine and Kramer sit on Newman's couch. Elaine with her head tilted
back. Newman sits in his chair, his fingertips together, trying to give an
Impression of limitless wisdom.

ELAINE
So, that's the situation.

NEWMAN
Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly
has a legitimate claim to the bicycle, and yet the bicycle can have only one
rightful owner. Quite the conundrum. As a federal employee, I believe the law is
all we have. (getting worked up) It's all that separates us from the savages
who don't deserve even the privilege of the daily mail. (angry) Stuffing parcels
into mailboxes where they don't belong!!...

KRAMER
Newman!
Newman catches himself, and comes back to normality.

NEWMAN
...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, no
Matter how unjust it may seem to either of you. Do I have your word?

KRAMER
Uh, yeah.

ELAINE
Yeah.

NEWMAN
Alright, let's begin.
Newman sits back, to begin his contemplation. There is the single
'ting' of a microwave.

NEWMAN
(excited) Ooh, my cocoa!
Newman leaps to his feet and heads for his kitchen.
 
[Ken and Carrie's Apartment]
Carrie is on the couch, with Ken sitting on the arm. George is
explaining about Seven.

KEN
Why can't we use Seven?

GEORGE
It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.

CARRIE
Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant. You've already postponed
The wedding. Who knows if you'll ever get married.

GEORGE
Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't
waffle!

KEN
Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name.
It's very unusual.

GEORGE
(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on
Soda.

KEN
(emphatic) Well, we don't care for Soda.

GEORGE
You don't care for Soda?!

CARRIE
(worked up) No, no. We don't like Soda at all!

GEORGE
(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's
refreshing!
Carrie jumps and gives a cry.

CARRIE
Oh!

KEN
What is it?

CARRIE
I felt something.

KEN
Are you okay, honey?

CARRIE
I think I'm going into labour.
George flashes a panicked expression.

KEN
Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the
hospital...
Ken and Carrie rise and head toward the door.

CARRIE
Okay.

KEN
...Alright? I got the suitcase packed, right here.
Ken grabs the suitcase from by the door and they exit, hurriedly.
George trails along behind them, making suggestions.

GEORGE
What about Six?
Ken gives him a look over his shoulder.

GEORGE
Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.
Ken has left, George follows out the door.

GEORGE
Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen!
George closes the door behind him.
 
[Restaurant]
Jerry and Christie are having dinner. Christie is eating, while Jerry
leans back picking at his meal, looking suspicious at the fact that Christie is
wearing the same black and white dress as at their two previous meetings.

CHRISTIE
Are you okay, Jerry? You seem quiet.

JERRY
No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.

CHRISTIE
I know exactly what you mean.

JERRY
Oh, I'm sure you do.
Christie begins to season her food, with salt. Jerry chews
thoughtfully.

JERRY (V.O.)
What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the
same thing over and over again? Or does she have a closet full of these, like
Superman? I've got to unlock this mystery.
Christie adds a little pepper to her dish. But after replacing the
shaker, she knocks her glass of red wine over her dress.

CHRISTIE
(horrified) Oh my god!

JERRY
Oh.
Christie mops at the spill with her napkin, but there's only so much
you can do.

CHRISTIE
Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we go
back to my apartment, so I can change?

JERRY
Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.
 
[Ken and Carrie's Car]
Ken is driving Carrie to the hospital. Carrie is as worked up as you'd
expect a woman in labor to be. In the back seat, George is making one last
attempt to save his name.

CARRIE
Are we almost there?

KEN
Just keep breathing, okay.

CARRIE
(deep breaths) Okay, okay.

KEN
Okay.

GEORGE
(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow
Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
As George speaks, Ken is looking impatient and angry.

KEN
Now's not the best time, George!

GEORGE
(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...

KEN
(firm) George! She's in labour!

GEORGE
(angry shout) So am I!
 
[Newman's Apartment]
Elaine and Kramer still sit on the couch, awaiting Newman's
arbitration.

NEWMAN
Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the
one hand, Elaine, your promise was given in haste. But was it not still a promise? Hmm?
Kramer looks at Elaine, thinking his arguments have put him one up.

NEWMAN
And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for
compensation. But, does the fee, once paid, not entitle the buyer to some assurance
Of reliability? Hmm? Huh? Ahh. These were not easy questions to answer.
Not for any man...
Kramer leans forward to receive the result. Elaine looks as attentive
as she can while only being able to look upwards.

NEWMAN
...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the
bike down the middle, and give half to each of you.

ELAINE
(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
Newman's face drops at her negative reaction. Kramer looks across at
the bike, looking worried.

ELAINE
Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing
in half.

KRAMER
No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another
than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.

ELAINE
Yeah, yeah, y-yeah.

NEWMAN
Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather
give it away than see it come to harm. Kramer, the bike is yours!

ELAINE
What?!

KRAMER
Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise.
Kramer picks up the bike and climbs aboard.

ELAINE
(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still
hurting me,
and now you have the bike?!

KRAMER
Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
Kramer opens the door and rides clumsily out, ringing the bell as he
goes.
 
[Christie's Apartment]
Christie leads Jerry into her home.

CHRISTIE
Here we are.

JERRY
(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
Christie puts down her bag, and removes her coat.

CHRISTIE
Well, I guess I'll go change.

JERRY
Yes, change. By all means, change.
Christie walks away down a hallway. Jerry removes his coat and sits
down. He looks around himself. On the coffee table he notices a small framed
picture of Christie and some guy. In the picture, she's wearing the same black and
White dress. Jerry picks it up and examines it more closely, reading a date
written on the photo.

JERRY (V.O.)
August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress!
She never
changes! Oh my god. (looking around) She's gotta have hundreds of these
dresses.
Jerry gets up from his seat.

JERRY (V.O.)
There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
Jerry opens a closet and begins to look inside. While he's rooting
about in there, Christie reenters the room, wearing a robe and looking indignant
at discovering Jerry invading her privacy.

CHRISTIE
Ahem! Are you looking for something?

JERRY
What're you doing? I thought you were changing.

CHRISTIE
No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night.

JERRY
No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.

CHRISTIE
If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to
bed.
Jerry moves to the couch, where he half lays down.

JERRY
You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on
The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out
together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll
of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go
downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.

CHRISTIE
(unequivocal) Jerry. I don't think so.
Jerry picks up his coat and moves toward the door.

JERRY
You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?

CHRISTIE
(gesturing) Get out.
Jerry walks though the door. He's still talking as Christie closes it
on him.

JERRY
(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you
lay it out on the bed.
 
[Hospital]
Carrie is in a wheelchair, being wheeled by an orderly. She's doing her
breathing. Ken hurries alongside, comforting his wife. George also
hustles along the corridor with the group.

KEN
Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe.

GEORGE
(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It
would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!

CARRIE
(shouts) I'm having a baby!!
The orderly pushes the wheelchair on through the door of the delivery
room. Ken turns to face George.

KEN
George, you're not getting Seven! Now get outta here!!
Ken strides into the delivery room.

GEORGE
(desperate) Please! I have so little!
George tries to follow, but an orderly blocks his path.

ORDERLY
Sorry sir, it's family only.
The orderly closes the door on George, whose face can be seen through
The window.

GEORGE
I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
George thumps his fists against the door in frustration. He's crying as
He screams.

GEORGE
Seven!!
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is on the phone, while Kramer examines a box of cereal in the
kitchen.

JERRY
Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again?
(listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone.
C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can
bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me.
(hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
Defeated, Jerry hangs up the phone.

KRAMER
(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking
On these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.

JERRY
Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little
Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
Jerry tears a sheet off a writing pad, and presents it to Kramer.
Kramer takes a look.

KRAMER
(does a double take) Yikes.

JERRY
I know. Pretty steep.

KRAMER
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.

JERRY
Few do.

KRAMER
I'm good for it.

JERRY
Yeah, well, until this bill is paid...
Jerry takes back the tab, then takes the cereal out of Kramer's hands.

JERRY
...the food court is closed.

KRAMER
(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five
minutes. And, don't eat any more.
Kramer leaves at a run.
 
[Street]
Elaine is walking along, when she spots something ahead of her.

ELAINE
Hey, that's my bike!
Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn
for all he's worth. He rings the bell.

NEWMAN
Gangway!

ELAINE
This is my bike!
Newman brakes to a halt in front of Elaine.

NEWMAN
Oh no. No no no no. I bought it from Kramer. He was hard up for
cash. Fifty bucks! (he laughs) Can you believe it? Of course, I had to make
some minor modifications, you know. Solid tires, reinforced seatpost, heavy duty
shocks. But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
Newman begins to ride away.

ELAINE
(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman,
gimme...
Elaine grabs hold of the trailing end of Newman's scarf.

NEWMAN
Hey!! Help me!
The show ends with a freeze frame of Newman on the bike, and a
determined Elaine grasping the scarf. There are sounds of a struggle.
End.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry enters, carrying a couple of bags and his mail. No sooner has he put
his bags down than Kramer enters.

KRAMER
Hey! You're back!

JERRY
Oh, I'm back, baby.

KRAMER
Yeah, how was it?

JERRY
Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.

KRAMER
Good for you.

JERRY
I killed.

KRAMER
You killed.

JERRY
(taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and
(hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable.

KRAMER
Unbelievable.

JERRY
Yeah. Highest paying job I ever had.

KRAMER
How much?

JERRY
(reluctant) Nah, nah. I'd rather...

KRAMER
Aw, c'mon.

JERRY
Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the
friendship.

KRAMER
I tell you how much I make.

JERRY
And I'm always impressed.

KRAMER
Just show me the cheque, c'mon.

JERRY
Awright, fine. You wanna see it?

KRAMER
I wanna see it.

JERRY
Okay.
Jerry gets out his wallet, extracts a cheque from within it and hands it to
Kramer.

JERRY
Here, check that out.
Kramer reads the cheque, and a look of astonishment comes to his face.

KRAMER
(stunned) Whuf! This is unbelievable.

JERRY
I told you.
Kramer has to sit on the couch, he's so shocked.

KRAMER
My god, you're rich.

JERRY
(taking back the check) Oh yeah.

KRAMER
I didn't know you made that kinda money. (subdued) Jeez.

JERRY
What?

KRAMER
I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.

JERRY
I never shoulda told you.

KRAMER
You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I
feel it. Do you feel it?

JERRY
No, I can't feel anything.

KRAMER
Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?

JERRY
Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to
charity.

KRAMER
(pleased) Really?

JERRY
(deadpan) No.

KRAMER
Well, you should, Jerry.

JERRY
No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new
car.

KRAMER
Now, you see, that's nice.

JERRY
Maybe a Cadillac.

KRAMER
(smiles) Cadillac. Ooh-la-la.

JERRY
Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted
one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna
do it.

KRAMER
You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this
one.

JERRY
Oh, isn't that what it's all about?
Kramer and Jerry smile in agreement.
[Monk's]
Elaine sits in a booth, across from her friend Katy.

ELAINE
Who was Pippi Longstocking?

KATY
Pippi Longstocking? (thoughtful) Hmm, I don't don't know.

ELAINE
Did she have anything to do with Hitler?

KATY
Hitler? (thinks) Maybe.
George enters and walks over to the booth. He's looking impatient.

GEORGE
Hey.

ELAINE
Hey George.

GEORGE
Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock.
George twists round, so he can watch the door.

ELAINE
(indicating) You remember Katy?

GEORGE
(distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.

KATY
Also ear, nose and throat.

GEORGE
Nose. (chuckles) What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What
does it get? Stuffed? (chuckles)

KATY
(amused) He's funny.

ELAINE
Ah, you don't have to tell me.

GEORGE
Ahh, ladies, please, please. (chuckles)

ELAINE
Oh, you know what? He got engaged.

KATY
Oh, you did? (disappointed) Oh.

GEORGE
What? Is that bad?

KATY
I actually would've set you up with a friend of mine.

GEORGE
Oh-ho, yeah?

KATY
You'd be perfect for her. She loves quirky, funny guys.

GEORGE
(curious) Bald? Uh?

KATY
Loves bald.

GEORGE
Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she?

KATY
Marisa Tomei.

GEORGE
(taken aback) The actress?

KATY
Yeah.

GEORGE
You're friends with Marisa Tomei?

KATY
That's right.

GEORGE
(getting excited) That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I
love her, she was fantastic!

KATY
Yeah, I know.

GEORGE
(more excitement) You were gonna fix me up with her?

KATY
Yeah, she's just been sitting home.

GEORGE
(fever pitch) Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't
you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!

ELAINE
(deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is talking on the phone as George enters and hangs up his coat.

JERRY
I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get
it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye.
Jerry hangs up and turns to George.

JERRY
Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac

GEORGE
Really? Wow, you're quite the good son.

JERRY
Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.
Jerry walks to the kitchen.

GEORGE
You gonna sleep on the fold-out?

JERRY
(joyless) Yeah, yes.
Jerry opens the fridge door and gets out a piece of pie on a plate.

GEORGE
Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?

JERRY
The actress?

GEORGE
Yeah. She's uh, she's something, isn't she?

JERRY
Oh yeah.

GEORGE
Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend?

JERRY
Yeah?

GEORGE
She happens to be very good friends with her.

JERRY
Marisa Tomei?

GEORGE
Uh-hmm.

JERRY
How does she know Marisa Tomei?

GEORGE
I don't know, I didn't ask.

JERRY
You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?

GEORGE
Not the point!

JERRY
Alright.

GEORGE
Can I finish?

JERRY
Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I
would've asked her.
Jerry opens the freezer compartment and gets out a tub of ice cream.

GEORGE
Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.

JERRY
What d'you mean, could've?

GEORGE
Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.

JERRY
Ohh!

GEORGE
Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!

JERRY
Really?
Jerry puts a scoop of ice cream on the pie.

GEORGE
(getting animated) Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being
anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa
Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.

JERRY
You know, she won an academy award?

GEORGE
(sarcasm) Hu-hu, like I don't know that? (excitement) My Cousin
Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar
winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if
fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!

JERRY
Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.

GEORGE
I mean, you've seen her, right?

JERRY
Katherine Hepburn? Oh yeah.

GEORGE
(shout) Marisa Tomei!

JERRY
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

GEORGE
I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair,
the full lips.
George wanders to the couch, Jerry following with his plate of pie and ice
cream.

JERRY
You like full lips.

GEORGE
Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on.
The two sit on the couch.

JERRY
Mmm-mmm. Too bad you're engaged.
Jerry takes a mouthful of pie.

GEORGE
(downcast) Yeah, too bad. Too bad.
There is a knock at the door.

JERRY
(about the pie) This is no good.
Jerry puts down the plate, gets up and opens the door, to reveal a guy in a
Plaza Cable cap.

JERRY
Hi.

NICK
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm uh, I'm with Plaza Cable. I'm sorry to bother
you. I...I'm looking for the guy who lives over here. Been waiting about uh,
heh, two hours. You uh, happen to know where he is?

JERRY
No.

NICK
If you see him, Could you just tell him the cable company was here?

JERRY
Sure.

NICK
Thanks.
The guy leaves. Jerry closes the door and returns to the couch.

JERRY
(about the cable guy) Nice people.
Jerry sits beside George again.

GEORGE
Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with
her?

JERRY
Well, what about Susan?

GEORGE
(worked up) I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not
allowed to have coffee?!

JERRY
Would you tell Susan about it?

GEORGE
(frustrated) Not necessarily.

JERRY
Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.

GEORGE
(shouts) Of course there's something wrong! (points at Jerry) We had
a pact!
Jerry heads for the fridge, just as Kramer enters.

JERRY
Hey, cable guy's looking for you.

KRAMER
Oh, yeah?

JERRY
Yeah.

KRAMER
Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just
found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out.

JERRY
Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.

KRAMER
Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept
waiting.

JERRY
You don't seem too bothered by it.

KRAMER
You remember what they did to me ten years ago? "Oh, we'll be there
in the morning between nine and one", or "We'll be there between two and
six"! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a
phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice
clean floors. (malice) Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks
like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?

JERRY
Boy, I've never seen you like this.

KRAMER
Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.
[George's Apartment]
George sits on his couch, watching My Cousin Vinnie on video. Onscreen,
Marisa Tomei, is in court, explaining transmission systems.

MARISA
...positrack, which was not available on the sixty-four Buick
Skylark.
Susan enters

SUSAN
Hey. (glances at TV) Hey what're you watching? What is that? My
Cousin Vinnie?

GEORGE
Yeah.
Susan stands behind George as she speaks.

SUSAN
I thought you saw that before. How come you're watching that again?

GEORGE
I..I..I dunno.

SUSAN
Did you know Marisa Tomei won an Oscar for that? Boy, she's
beautiful, don't you think? I wish I looked like that.
George daren't say anything, but from his expression it's clear he wishes
Susan looked like that.

SUSAN
Turn it off. You're making me jealous. I'm gonna think you like her
more than you like me.
Susan leaves to the bedroom.

GEORGE
(forcing a laugh) Hu, ha.
When Susan has gone, George picks up the phone and dials, keeping an eye
open in case Susan returns.
[George's Apartment/Elaine's Apartment]

ELAINE (O.C.)
Hello.

GEORGE
(whispering) Elaine, it's me, George.
Elaine is sitting up in bed, reading a newspaper as she speaks to George.

ELAINE
George. How come you're whispering?

GEORGE
(still quiet) Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour.
Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?

ELAINE
No.

GEORGE
(still quiet) Think, a second. You know, your friend was talking
about me and, you know...

ELAINE
Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about.

GEORGE
(still quiet) The actress.

ELAINE
What?

GEORGE
(shouts) Marisa Tomei!
Susan hears from the bedroom.

SUSAN (O.C.)
What?

GEORGE
(calling to Susan) Uh, ah, nothing. Nothing.

ELAINE
Oh, yeah. Yeah, what about her?

GEORGE
Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it.

ELAINE
What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged!

GEORGE
A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything.

ELAINE
Uhh. No George!

GEORGE
Elaine.

ELAINE
Forget it!
Elaine hangs up her phone in disgust.

GEORGE
Elaine! (shouts) ELAINE!!
Susan walks back in on George at this point. George quickly slips the phone
under a cushion to conceal it, and goes back to watching My Cousin Vinnie,
to provide an excuse for his raised voice.

GEORGE
D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!
Susan looks at him oddly.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is packing some gear into a bag, while Elaine watches and Kramer peers
out into the hall through Jerry's peephole.

ELAINE
I can't believe you're buying your father a car.

JERRY
And, best of all, it's a Cadillac.

ELAINE
(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow.
Elaine seems to become a lot more interested in Jerry. She moves over to the
table where Jerry's packing, and turns the 'flirt' knob to the 'on'
position.

ELAINE
I had no idea you had this kind of money.

JERRY
Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.

ELAINE
Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in
this kind of, you know, uh... position.

JERRY
Ah, it's just money.

ELAINE
(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?

JERRY
Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?

ELAINE
I don't know. (big smile) Just, things seem a little more exciting
when you're around. That's all.

JERRY
Are you okay?

ELAINE
(squeaky) Sure, sure.

JERRY
What was that?
Kramer sees something through the peephole. He motions Jerry and Elaine to
quieten down.

KRAMER
Quiet, quiet.
[Jerry's Apartment/Hall Outside Jerry's Apartment]
Nick, the cable guy is standing by Kramer's door. George wanders up to
Jerry's door and, as he gets there, is addressed.

NICK
Hey, uh, you know the guy who lives here?

GEORGE
Yeah.
George moves to open Jerry's door, but the cable guy is still talking.

NICK
(quietly angry) All morning I been waiting here. All morning.
Peering through the peephole, Kramer makes a noise of excited satisfaction.

NICK
(still angry) The guy says he's gonna be home. I show up and all I do
is wait. I'm getting pretty sick and tired of it. I'm not gonna put up with
it much longer.
The cable guy stalks away. Inside Jerry's, Kramer turns to speak to Jerry
and Elaine.

KRAMER
I'm loving this.
Kramer lowers his eye to the peephole again, just as George opens the door.
The door cracks Kramer on the forehead with a thump. George enters. Kramer
peers round George to check the cable guy's gone.

GEORGE
Kramer, there's a guy out here that...

KRAMER
Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.
Kramer exits and crosses the hall to his apartment. George closes the door
behind himself, and takes off his coat. He notices Elaine.

GEORGE
(pointedly to Elaine) Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the
way.

ELAINE
Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be
a part of this!

GEORGE
(animated) Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix
up!

ELAINE
You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?

GEORGE
(defensive) So what? So what if I do?

ELAINE
(shrill) You're engaged!

GEORGE
(worked up) I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine.
An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been
with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky,
balding funny men!

JERRY
I notice you threw 'stocky' in there.

GEORGE
Yeah, what the hell?!

ELAINE
George! It's cheating.

GEORGE
(adamant) It's not cheating if there's no sex!

ELAINE
Yes it is!

GEORGE
(frustrated) Ahh!

ELAINE
(looking for support) Jerry!
Jerry is standing by the kitchen counter. He has a stack of bank notes and
is counting them. Elaine is mesmerised by the sight of all that currency.
She stands by the counter, her eyes locked onto the money.

JERRY
Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses counting) I'm, I'm sorry, I
didn't hear what you said.
Elaine looks almost dizzy at the prospect of all that cash.

GEORGE
(pleading) Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? (indicates
the phone) Please, make the call.

ELAINE
(distractedly) Yeah, yeah, fine, I'll make...
Elaine picks up the phone and dials a number.

GEORGE
(triumph) Alright.
Jerry resumes his counting, but has lost track of where he was up to. He
stands, holding one bill, trying to recall. Elaine has obviously been paying
more attention, even as she dialled the phone.

ELAINE
Eight-fifty.

JERRY
Oh, right.
Elaine waits for the phone to be picked up.

ELAINE
So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or...

JERRY
No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
As Jerry goes to leave the kitchen, Elaine is sure to keep in his path,
smiling flirtatiously.

ELAINE
You sure? You sure? 'Cos, you know...

JERRY
Maybe I'll let you pick me up.

ELAINE
(big smile) Okay.
Jerry is finally allowed out of the kitchen by Elaine, and heads for the
bedroom. The phone is picked up at the other end of Elaine's line. As Elaine
speaks, George stands beside her, doing a little selection of dances.

ELAINE
Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? (listens) Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens)
Oh, really?
Something about the tone of her voice causes George to cease dancing.

ELAINE
Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.
Elaine turns to an expectant George.

ELAINE
Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia.

GEORGE
(impatient) What about Marisa Tomei?!
[Morty and Helen's, Florida]
Morty is eating a cookie at the kitchen table. Helen comes over and grabs
the box he's eating from.

HELEN
Morty, what d'you have to open this box for? (waving at another box)
There's already a box of cookies open.

MORTY
I wanted a Chip Ahoy.

HELEN
I don't like all these open boxes.
Helen puts both boxes of cookies away in a cupboard.

MORTY
Look, I got a few good years left. If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having
it.
The door opens and Jerry enters, carrying his bags.

JERRY
Surprise!

MORTY
(shout) Jerry!

HELEN
(shock) Oh, my god!

MORTY
What the hell are you doing here?

JERRY
I'm a good son.

HELEN
Just like that? No calls?

JERRY
Just like that.

MORTY
Boy, you are really something.

HELEN
To what do we owe this great honour?

JERRY
You wanna know? Come on outside.

MORTY
Outside? What's going on?

HELEN
Whenever Jerry comes, something exciting happens.
Helen darts out of the door eagerly.

MORTY
(laughs) Heh hah!

JERRY
C'mon, c'mon.
Morty follows Helen outside.
[Outside Morty and Helen's, Florida]
Standing at the kerb is a brand new, silver, Cadillac, gleaming in the
Floridian sunshine. Jerry leads Morty and Helen over to it.

JERRY
Well, what d'you think?

MORTY
Look at this! Look at this! (excited) You bought a Cadillac?!

JERRY
I bought it for you. It's yours.
Morty and Helen both look astonished.

MORTY
You what? You bought me a Cadillac?

JERRY
I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go.

HELEN
(sharply, to Jerry) Are you out of your mind?

JERRY
What?

MORTY
(to Helen) You don't want it? Are you kidding?

HELEN
He's not buying us a Cadillac.

MORTY
What are you, nuts?

HELEN
It's a very nice gesture Jerry, but take it back.
Helen wrests the keys from Morty's grasp and hands them back to Jerry.

MORTY
(to Jerry) Can you believe this?!

HELEN
I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac. He hasn't got that kind of
money.

JERRY
How d'you know?

HELEN
Oh, get out of here Mister Big Shot.

JERRY
Why can't I buy my father a car?

HELEN
Your father doesn't need a car.

MORTY
Yes, I do!
Morty grabs the keys back from Jerry.

HELEN
Oh, Morty.

MORTY
We're keeping it.

HELEN
Over my dead body.
Helen makes another grab for the keys, and she and Morty struggle for
possession, watched by Jerry.

JERRY
(under his breath) Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.
[Kramer's Apartment]
Kramer sits on his couch reading a newspaper. Beside him, on a table, are
his phone and an answering machine. The phone rings, but Kramer doesn't
answer, instead allowing the machine to pick up.

MACHINE (KRAMER)
Giddyup.

NICK (O.C.)
Yeah, this is Nick Stevens, from Plaza Cable.
Kramer smiles on hearing the voice.

NICK (O.C.)
Well, I waited all morning again. You said you were gonna be
there from nine to one.
Kramer puts down his paper and stretches out on the couch to listen.

NICK (O.C.)
I was there. Where were you? You think I got nothing better to
do than stand outside all morning, waiting for you to show up?!
Kramer waves his fist, mocking the cable guy's anger. He laughs to himself.

NICK (O.C.)
You're not gonna get away with this!
[Outside Morty and Helen's, Florida]
Morty is sitting in the Cadillac, with Jerry leaning on the door. They're
going through the features of the car.

MORTY
Hey Jerry, look at this. My seat's got a memory, in case somebody
moves it. I could be in prison for five years. I come out, my seat goes
right back to where I like it.

JERRY
That's what I was thinking.
Jack Klompus approaches the car.

JACK
(pointing) Hello, Jerry.

JERRY
Hiya, Jack.
Morty gets out of the car, shuts the door and leans against it.

MORTY
(indicating) So, how d'you like this?

JACK
Who's car?

MORTY
It's mine.

JACK
Yours?

MORTY
That's right. My son bought it for me.

JACK
He what?

MORTY
My son bought me the car. It's a present.

JACK
(disbelief) You bought it?

JERRY
That's right. I bought it.

MORTY
You ever see one so nice?

JACK
Some car.

MORTY
You wanna take a ride?

JACK
No, thank you.

MORTY
C'mon, take a ride.

JACK
I don't wanna take a ride.

MORTY
Why not?

JACK
I don't feel like taking a ride. Do I have to take a ride?!

JERRY
He doesn't wanna take a ride.

MORTY
Uh huh.

JACK
(worked up) What d'you think? I've never ridden in a Cadillac before?
Believe me, I've ridden in a Cadillac hundreds of times. Thousands.

MORTY
(skeptical) Thousands?!

JACK
What? D'you think you're such a big shot now, because you got a
Cadillac?

MORTY
(dismissive) Ahh!

JACK
(dismissive) Yaah!
Jack angrily stalks away.

MORTY
Could you believe that guy?

JERRY
Aahh!
[Hospital Room]
George sits, talking enthusiastically to someone.

GEORGE
Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.
The person he's talking to is Katy, who's unconscious, wearing an oxygen
mask and has an intravenous drip in her.

GEORGE
You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that
I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something
you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's,
it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin
Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh,
you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So,
what d'you, what d'you think?
Katy is still unconscious.

GEORGE
(urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?
[Kramer's Apartment]
Kramer is reading a magazine on the couch. The phone rings and he answers
it.

KRAMER
Y'hello.

NICK (O.C.)
(inexpertly disguising his voice) Hi, uh ah, Mister Kramer, ah,
this is McNab down at the phone company. We've got a report about some
trouble on your line.
Kramer smiles, as he recognises the voice.

KRAMER
Hmm. Well, I haven't had any trouble.

NICK (O.C.)
Uh, the thing is, we happen to have a man right in your
neighbourhood.
Kramer walks over to his window, and uses his fingers to open a couple of
blades on his blinds. Peering through, he can see a public phone box across
the street. Parked beside the box is a truck emblazoned with the Plaza Cable
insignia, and in the box is the familiar figure of Nick, the cable guy.

KRAMER
(playing along) Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a
little trouble with my call-waiting.

NICK
We can fix that. We can fix that.

KRAMER
(sitting back on the couch) Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as
it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company
would know that.

NICK
Oh, right. (laughing it off) I'm sorry, I was looking at the wrong
work order.

KRAMER
Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the
stove.
Kramer puts the phone down beside a radio and switches it on. It plays
cheesy music into the phone. Kramer gets up and heads out the door.
[Street]
Nick, the cable guy, stands in the phone box. He's listening to the cheesy
music on the phone, and getting impatient. He glances at his watch.
Suddenly, a car horn blares and a shout is heard.

KRAMER
Hey, McNab!
THe cable guy turns, to see Kramer leaning out of the window of a cab as it
passes.

KRAMER
Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?
Kramer waves and smiles happily at the dumbstruck cable guy, as the cab
accelerates away.
[Tenant's Committee, Florida]
Around a table sit a number of residents, including an unhappy looking Jack
Klompus. Morty is standing behind a lectern addressing the gathering. He
bangs a gavel to get their attention.

MORTY
Alright. Next thing on the agenda, the restoration of the fence at
the Briarwood gate. At the present time, we are still accepting bids.

HERB
C'mon Morty, it's been broken for six months already. What the hell
are you doing?

MORTY
Well, I, as your president, have to find the best price, and right
now, I for one, do not think it's cost-feasible.

JACK
(half to himself) I'll bet you don't.

MORTY
What was that?

JACK
C'mon Morty, the jig is up!

MORTY
What're you talking about?

JACK
I'm sorry. I'm sitting here, the whole meeting, holding my tongue.
I've known you a long time, Morty, but I cannot hold it in any longer.

HERB
What's going on, Jack?

JACK
I'll tell you what's going on. Morty Seinfeld has been stealing funds
from the treasury.

MORTY
Stealing?!

RALPH
What proof do you have?

JACK
Proof? You want proof? He's driving around in a brand new Cadillac.
Now what more proof do you want?

MORTY
My son bought me that car!

JACK
Your son?

MORTY
Yeah.

JACK
Your son could never afford that car. We all saw his act, last year,
at the playhouse. He's lucky he can pay his rent!

HERB
Jack's right! He stinks!

RALPH
It's his material.

MORTY
I tell you, he bought it for me!

HERB
(bangs table with his fist) I move for a full investigation!

RALPH
I second.
Morty looks dumbstruck.
[George's Apartment]
George sits on the couch, watching Only You on the video. Onscreen, the
ever-lovely Marisa is delivering her lines.

MARISA
...go introduce myself.
Susan enters, with a bag of groceries.

SUSAN
Hey! What're you watching? (looks at TV) Only You? That's another
Marisa Tomei movie, and you've seen that one too. (jokingly) What, d'you
have a thing for her?

GEORGE
(laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for
Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man.
(forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar
winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not
like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with
Marisa Tomei?

SUSAN
What are you talking about?
Susan wanders away into the kitchen with the groceries, looking bemused by
George. George watches her go, staring at the kitchen door as he slips off
into a daydream.
[George Dream Sequence]
George stares at the kitchen door, which glows with golden light. Then
Marisa Tomei slinks out of the kitchen in a long black dress, and her hair
up. She comes and sits beside George on the couch, looking at him lovingly.

MARISA
Have I told you how much I love you today?

GEORGE
Not in the last fifteen minutes.

MARISA
Well, I do love you very much.

GEORGE
And I love you, Marisa.

MARISA
Well then, c'mon, get dressed. We're going to be late for the
premiere.
George leans across and takes Marisa in his arms. They kiss and slowly
recline onto the couch.
[George's Apartment]
Susan returns from the kitchen, to find George kissing, and slowly reclining
onto the couch with, a cushion. George runs a hand across his head, in the
fashion of a loving Marisa's caress. Then he raises his head from the
cushion to see Susan observing him. She turns and goes back into the
kitchen, wordlessly. George puts the cushion on the arm of the couch and
lies down.
[Morty and Helen's, Florida]
Jerry sits on the couch and Helen is in the kitchen, as an anxious Morty
delivers his news.

HELEN
Impeachment?

MORTY
That's right. Have you ever heard of anything like that?

HELEN
Can they do that?

MORTY
If they get the votes.

HELEN
I told you we shouldn't have let him give us the car.

JERRY
Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for
it.

MORTY
It doesn't make a difference. They think we're in cahoots.

JERRY
You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an
insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!

MORTY
No-one's ever been impeached before. I couldn't live here. We'd have
to move to Boca.
There's a knock at the door, and then it is opened and Evelyn walks in.

EVELYN
Hello?

JERRY
Oh, hi Evelyn.
Morty sits by the table.

EVELYN
Hello, Jerry. (to the senior Seinfelds) I just got off the phone
with Saul Brandus.

HELEN
What'd he say?

EVELYN
He's voting to impeach.
Morty thumps the table with his fist.

EVELYN
Not because he think you stole the money, but mainly because you
never thanked him for giving you his aisle seat at Freddy Roman's show.

MORTY
I did so thank him!

HELEN
(admonishing) No, he never heard you. (prods Morty's back) I told you
he didn't hear you.

MORTY
Ah, he's deaf anyway.

EVELYN
Now, my sources tell me, there's three votes for impeachment, three
votes against impeachment, and one undecided.

MORTY
Who's that?

EVELYN
Mrs Choate.

JERRY
Who's she?

MORTY
Oh, that one. She's been a member of the board longer than anybody.
She's very tough to deal with.

HELEN
Maybe we should have her over for coffee, and explain our side of it?

MORTY
That's a good idea.

EVELYN
Okay. I'll see you at the Lichtenberg's, tonight.

HELEN
(surprise) The Lichtenberg's?

EVELYN
Yes, they're having a party.

HELEN
We weren't invited.

EVELYN
Oh. Probably they think you're too good for them. You know, because
of the car.
Jerry puts his face in his hands.
End.
[Montage]

JERRY (V.O.)
Last week, on Seinfeld.
A selection of scenes from The Cadillac (1) establish the story so far.
[Morty and Helen's, Florida]
Jerry is trying, unsuccessfully, to sleep on the infamous fold-out. He twists
and turns, but can't find a comfortable position.

JERRY (V.O.)
Ow. Stupid fold-out! Why'd they put the bar in the middle of the
bed?
Jerry continues to thrash about in discomfort. The phone rings and Jerry picks
it up.

JERRY
Hello?
On the other end of the line is Elaine, in bed back in New York.

ELAINE
(flirtatious) Hi Jerry.

JERRY
Elaine? Wh..what's going on?
Elaine rests on one elbow, playing with her hair as she chats playfully with
Jerry.

ELAINE
(clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much
this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down
there and hang out a little.

JERRY
(a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of
Mar Gables?
Elaine gives a slightly overdone girly giggle-laugh at Jerry's comment.

ELAINE
Well, it's just two hours by plane...

JERRY
Gee, I dunno what to tell you.
There is a beep from Elaine's phone.

ELAINE
Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.
Elaine hits a button on her phone to take the other call.

ELAINE
Yeah?
The other call is George. He sits on his couch in his dressing gown.

GEORGE
(urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone
number!

ELAINE
(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll
get you her number.
George punches the air in triumph, and sits back on the couch.

GEORGE
Yeahhh.

ELAINE
Goodbye.
Elaine hits the button on her phone again, to reconnect with Jerry.

ELAINE
(smiling and flirty) Hi.

JERRY
Hi.

ELAINE
So, what d'you think?

JERRY
Uh, I don't think so.

ELAINE
(disappointed) Oh.

JERRY
I'll be back on Monday.

ELAINE
Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh.
I can meet you at the gate, Jer.

JERRY
Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll see you.
Jerry is moving to put down the phone when Elaine speaks.

ELAINE
(urgent) Jerry? Jerry?

JERRY
(putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.

ELAINE
(breathy) Bye.

JERRY
Bye.
Jerry puts down the phone, still a little bemused by Elaine.
[Kramer's Apartment]
The phone rings and Kramer picks up.

KRAMER
Hello.
Somewhere outside, a guy in overalls and a safety helmet is on the phone. He's
writing on a clipboard as he speaks to Kramer.

JOHN
Hello, Mister Kramer? This is John Hanaran, from Con Ed.
Kramer gets a smile on his face, thinking it's another of the cable guy's
tricks.

KRAMER
Ohh, it's Hanaran now, is it?

JOHN (V.O.)
Yeah. We've had some reports of power surges in your building. It
seems some jokers were up on the roof, and they must've damaged some of the
wires.

KRAMER
Oh, you don't say.
Kramer walks to his window as he listens.

JOHN
(a little confused by Kramer) Yeah. Either way, we need to get into your
apartment and do a safety check.
Kramer opens his blinds slightly, as he did before. But there is no cable guy in
the phone box across the street, only a woman talking on the phone.

KRAMER
(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.

JOHN
(confused) What're you talking about?
Kramer hits a button to end the call, and puts the phone back on the table.
John, the power guy, stares at his phone in disbelief.
[Monk's]
Elaine sits in a booth. George enters, looking unnaturally happy, and comes
over.

GEORGE
Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine)
And I wasn't even that nervous.
Elaine watches George, as he rambles on.

GEORGE
You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being
nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...

ELAINE
(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today.
Why don't we pick up with this next week?
Elaine rises.

GEORGE
Hey, where you going?

ELAINE
I got stuff to do.

GEORGE
What? You can't leave yet.

ELAINE
Why not?

GEORGE
We have to discuss my alibi.

ELAINE
Alibi? What does that have to do with me?

GEORGE
I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know
what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.

ELAINE
Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?

GEORGE
Yes.

ELAINE
(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.
Elaine sets off to leave, but is stopped by George.

GEORGE
Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?

ELAINE
What is the difference?

GEORGE
Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync.
Hmm?
Reluctantly, Elaine sits back down with a sigh, as George furrows his brow in
concentration.

GEORGE
Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?
George and Elaine both think hard for a moment. Then Elaine gets a flash of
inspiration.

ELAINE
Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to
go with me.
Elaine smiles and makes a 'voila' gesture.

GEORGE
(dismissive) It's no good.
Elaine looks offended.

ELAINE
(pointedly) Okay. Fine.

GEORGE
What?

ELAINE
I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.

GEORGE
Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take
process.

ELAINE
I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a
little more tactful.

GEORGE
(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked
together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of
working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's
not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best
possible lie. That's what this is all about.

ELAINE
(weary) Okay.

GEORGE
Alright?

ELAINE
Okay.

GEORGE
Okay.

ELAINE
Fine.

GEORGE
Good.

ELAINE
Fine, fine, fine.
The twosome go back to thinking for a while. This time George gets the
inspiration.

GEORGE
Okay. How about this?

ELAINE
What?

GEORGE
(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I
am meeting you to discuss the situation.

ELAINE
I don't have a boyfriend.

GEORGE
(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.

ELAINE
(not convinced) Ech.

GEORGE
It's good. Believe me.

ELAINE
I thought my idea was just as good.

GEORGE
The dentist thing?

ELAINE
(pointed) Yeah, right. The dentist thing.

GEORGE
Alright, the dentist thing was not good.

ELAINE
Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?

GEORGE
(after a moment's thought) Art Vandelay.

ELAINE
(incredulity) Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?

GEORGE
That's your boyfriend.

ELAINE
What does he do?

GEORGE
He's an importer.

ELAINE
Just imports? No exports?

GEORGE
(getting irritated) He's an importer-exporter. Okay?

ELAINE
Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?

GEORGE
(thoughtful) Yes. Yes.

ELAINE
(sighs) Yi-yi-yi.
Elaine and George go into another bout of deep thought.

ELAINE
Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's
thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And
this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?
Elaine finishes with an expectant smile. George looks skeptical, and Elaine
seems offended again.

ELAINE
(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?

GEORGE
It's very complicated.

ELAINE
(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and
none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am
Miss Stupid. Right?
George avoids Elaine's gaze, looking down.
[Morty and Helen's, Florida]
Helen is in the kitchen, putting cookies on a plate, as a restless Morty fusses
around.

MORTY
What're you doing? Are you making coffee?

HELEN
Yeah.

MORTY
Well, maybe you better make a pot of tea, too.

HELEN
Morty, you're driving me crazy.

MORTY
Look, I don't want anything to go wrong. If this woman votes to impeach
me, I'll be a laughing stock.

HELEN
You wanna drive a Cadillac? Expect to pay the consequences.
The doorbell chimes.

MORTY
There she is.
Morty and Helen both go to the door. Morty opens it and Mrs Choate enters.

MORTY
Hello. Hello, Mrs Choate.

HELEN
Oh, come in, come in. May I take your coat.

MRS. CHOATE
No, no. I prefer to wear it. Nobody's taking my coat.

HELEN
Ah, how 'bout a cup of coffee or something?

MRS. CHOATE
Coffee? Ach. I'll take hot water with lemon, if you have it.

HELEN
I'll see. (indicating the couch) Have a seat. That's a lovely scarf
you're wearing. Where did you get it?
Helen goes to the kitchen as Mrs Choate sits on the couch.

MRS. CHOATE
Ahh, they're a dime a dozen.
Jerry enters.

HELEN
Oh, hi Jerry. Mrs Choate, (indicating) this is my son, Jerry.
Mrs Choate turns to look at Jerry. Jerry looks astonished as he recognises Mrs
Choate. He remembers an incident from "The Rye".
[New York Street, "The Rye"]
Jerry grapples with Mrs Choate, for possession of a bag.

JERRY
Gimme that rye!

MRS. CHOATE
Stop it. Let go. Help! Someone, help!
Jerry wrests the bag from the old lady's grip.

JERRY
Shut up, you old bag!
Jerry races away down the street with the rye.

MRS. CHOATE
(shouting after him) Thief! Stop him! Stop him, he's got my rye!
[Morty and Helen's, Florida]
Jerry manages to regain a normal expression.

JERRY
Nice to meet you.

MRS. CHOATE
Hello.

MORTY
(holding Jerry's shoulders) Jerry lives in New York. You just came from
New York, didn't you?
Jerry looks desperate. The last thing he needs is Mrs Choate connecting him with
New York.

MRS. CHOATE
Yeah. I was visiting my daughter, and I'll never go back. The crime
there is just terrible. Do you know I got mugged for a marble rye, right on the
street?
Jerry gives a look of sympathy. Helen brings a couple of saucers and cups from
the kitchen, placing them on the table before Mrs Choate.

HELEN
(sympathy) Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye? Why would they steal a
rye?

MORTY
That's what the city's turning into. They'll steal anything.

MRS. CHOATE
They're like savages.

JERRY
Yeah, there's some sickos out there.

MRS. CHOATE
(peering at Jerry) You look very familiar. Have we ever met?

JERRY
You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?

HELEN
Maybe you've seen him on television.

MORTY
Jerry's a comedian.

MRS. CHOATE
Naw, I don't watch TV.
Jerry has moved rapidly to the door.

JERRY
(opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you.

MORTY
Jerry, don't go.

JERRY
Ah, I think I'll go.
Jerry darts out and shuts the door behind him.

MRS. CHOATE
So, Morty, what's this all about? What d'you want?
[George's Apartment]
Susan sits on the couch, reading. She spots George, in his coat, heading for the
door.

SUSAN
Hey, where're you going?

GEORGE
Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.

SUSAN
Elaine? What for?

GEORGE
I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's
seeing.

SUSAN
I didn't even know she was dating anyone.

GEORGE
Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.

SUSAN
So what does he do?

GEORGE
He's an importer-exporter.

SUSAN
What kind of problems are they having?

GEORGE
(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit
the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because
she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.
Susan looks unconvinced.

SUSAN
Are you having an affair with Elaine?

GEORGE
(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with
Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to
see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see,
and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.

SUSAN
Huh?
George gives a smile and slides out the door.
[Street]
Kramer strolls along the street, carrying a big bag of groceries. He becomes
aware that a vehicle is slowly driving along the road just behind him. Kramer
shifts his load of groceries, so that a shiny baking tray is in a position he
can use it as a mirror. Behind him, he can see the blurry image of a Plaza Cable
truck. Kramer begins to walk faster, then breaks into a run.
[Another Street]
Kramer slows from his run, and looks behind himself. A smile comes to his face,
as he sees the truck is no longer there. He allows himself a little shrug of
satisfaction at having beaten the cable guy. Kramer turns and begins to walk on,
with his groceries, when there is a screech of tyres and the cable truck comes
to a halt in front of him - having taken another route to head him off.
The cable guy gives a 'come here' gesture with his forefinger through the truck
window. Kramer turns and sets off running. He runs into a litter bin, drops his
groceries and falls to the floor. The cable guy climbs from his truck and begins
to advance on Kramer. Kramer picks himself up and, abandoning his groceries,
sets off running again, with the cable guy in pursuit.
[Variety of New York locations]
Kramer runs across a busy thoroughfare, followed, seconds later, by the cable
guy.
Kramer hauls himself over a wall in a park, looks around, and then sets off
running. Moments later, the cable guy struggles over the same wall and sets off
after Kramer.
Kramer runs across an expanse of grass in the park, with the cable guy just a
few yards behind.
Kramer runs across a New York rooftop. He comes to the edge of the roof and
looks for a way across to the next building. Kramer looks worriedly behind him,
for the pursuing cable guy, then down into the gap between buildings. Despite
his worry at the height, he steps back a few paces, takes a run-up, and leaps
across to land on the roof of the next building. Kramer picks himself up and
sets off running again. Behind him, the cable guy comes to the same gap, looks
down at how far he has to fall, and thinks better of attempting the leap.

NICK
(yelling after the fleeing Kramer) I'll get you! I'll get you Kramer! You
won't get away with this!
[Morty and Helen's, Florida]
Morty is fastening a jacket as he enters.

MORTY
Alright, are you ready to eat?

HELEN
(glancing at her watch) Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go, it's time
to eat. We're going to dinner.
Jerry wanders into the room. He's in a t-shirt and sweatpants, and holding a
comic book he's been reading.

JERRY
(confused) Dinner? W..What time is it?

HELEN
(pulling on a coat) It's four-thirty.

JERRY
(bewildered) Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty?

MORTY
By the time we sit down, it'll be quarter to five.

JERRY
I don't understand why we have to eat now.

HELEN
We gotta catch the early-bird. It's only between four-thirty and six.

MORTY
Yeah. They give you a tenderloin, a salad and a baked potato, for
four-ninety-five. You know what that cost you after six?

JERRY
Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?

HELEN
You're not buying us dinner.

JERRY
(emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a
coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!

HELEN
Alright, (sitting on the couch) we'll wait. (pointedly) But it's unheard
of.
Jerry shakes his head, incredulous, and wanders away with his comic book.
[Park]
George sits on a bench with Marisa Tomei. He's mid-speech, and Marisa's looking
interested, smiling and laughing.

GEORGE
...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a
word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is
also good. Ma-newer , right?

MARISA
(laughing) You're so right. I never thought of it like that. Manure.
'Ma' and the 'newer'.
Marisa laughs and George is smiling happily.

MARISA
Did you just make that up?

GEORGE
What, you think I'm doing material here?

MARISA
(laughs) No, no. It's hard to believe anyone could be so spontaneously
funny.

GEORGE
(modest) And I'm a little tired.
Marisa laughs again, then speaks, still smiling, but more seriously.

MARISA
So, tell me, how is it that a man like you, so bald, and so quirky and
funny, how is it you're not taken?

GEORGE
Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.
Marisa's face falls in disappointment.

MARISA
What?

GEORGE
I'm, you know, engaged.
Marisa's expression turns to anger. She swings a fist and punches George in the
face, then grabs her bag and storms away. George feels the painful spot where he
received the blow.
[Outside Scott's, Florida]
A few people stand around outside. The Seinfeld's Cadillac drives up to the
front of the restaurant. There's a gap in the parked cars, right by the
entrance.

JERRY (V.O)
Hey look, there's a spot right in front.

MORTY(V.O.)
Always, Jerry. Always.
The Cadillac pulls into the space. From the entrance of Scott's emerge Jack and
Doris Klompus, Jack using a toothpick

DORIS
Was that delicious or what?

JACK
Where you gonna get a better meal than that?

DORIS
Better than Danny's.

JACK
Danny's? (scoffs) C'mon!
The Seinfelds walk toward the entrance, where they meet the Klompus duo.

MORTY
Hello Jack.

HELEN
Doris.

DORIS
Hello, hello.

JERRY
Jack.

DORIS
Hello, Jerry.

JERRY
Hi Doris.

JACK
Hello Morty. (looking at watch) Well, missed the early bird.

MORTY
Yeah, so?

JACK
(pointed) Must be nice to have that kind of money.
Jack calls over to one of the people outside the restaurant.

JACK
Bernie, look who's eating at six o'clock. (pointed) Your suddenly
well-to-do president. But, you enjoy your last meal in office. Tomorrow, they
kick you out, you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.
Morty is looking confident, even smug.

MORTY
They're not kicking me out. You don't have the votes.

JACK
That's what you think.

MORTY
We'll see.

JACK
Yes, we will.

JERRY
Awright, let's eat already.
The Seinfelds enter Scott's, and Jack and Doris walk past the Cadillac.
[Elaine's Apartment]
Elaine answers a knock at the door, to find a slightly anxious looking Susan.

ELAINE
Hi, Susan.

SUSAN
Hi.

ELAINE
Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.
Susan walks in, and crosses to the couch. Elaine closes the door.

SUSAN
(standing) Uh, Elaine, I have to ask you a question.

ELAINE
Oh, sure.

SUSAN
(dead serious) Are you having an affair with George?

ELAINE
(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no.
Elaine has to sit on the arm of a chair, she's laughing so hard.

ELAINE
(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone
wanna sleep...
Elaine realises who she's speaking to, and the laughter dies away.

ELAINE
...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would
you think I was having an affair with George?

SUSAN
Ohh, because he said that he had to talk with you earlier about some
problem that you were having.

ELAINE
(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I
definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.

SUSAN
Art Vandelay?

ELAINE
Yeah, Art Vandelay.

SUSAN
I'm sorry. (laughing it off) I feel like an idiot.

ELAINE
(smiling) No, no. (laughing) Huh-hu-hu. It's okay.

SUSAN
Oh, just forget that we ever talked. Okay?

ELAINE
It is so forgotten.

SUSAN
Alright.
Susan moves toward the door.

ELAINE
Okay. (relieved) Okay, no problem.
Susan has the door open, when a thought occurs to her.

SUSAN
So, was George helpful at all?

ELAINE
(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm,
because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his
business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.

SUSAN
(not convinced) Yeah.

ELAINE
(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in
my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.

SUSAN
(spotting an inconsistency) Wait a minute. I thought that Art wanted to
give up the exporting.

ELAINE
What'd I say?

SUSAN
The importing.

ELAINE
(caught out) I did. Uh...

SUSAN
So, what does he uh, import?

ELAINE
(extemporising) Uh... chips.

SUSAN
Oh. What kinda chips?

ELAINE
Potato.

SUSAN
Ah.

ELAINE
(embroidering) Some corn.

SUSAN
And what does he export?

ELAINE
Diapers.

SUSAN
(fake smile) I'm sorry for bothering you.

ELAINE
Oh, no, it's okay.
Susan and Elaine both use fake laughs, as Susan leaves and closes the door.

ELAINE
Okay.
The moment the door closes behind Susan, Elaine races to her phone and dials a
number hurriedly. She stands, listening to the ring, desperate for a response.

ELAINE
(to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.
[George's Apartment]
Susan stands sifting through some magazines, when the door opens and George
enters. He's still feeling his face where Marisa punched him.

GEORGE
Hi.

SUSAN
Hi. (pointedly) So, George, what does Art Vandelay import?
George looks surprised by the question, and thinks for a moment before replying.

GEORGE
Matches? Long matches.
Susan raises her arm, and delivers the second punch that George has received
today. George is thrown backwards out of the door by the blow, and Susan slams
the door behind him.
[Tenant's Committee, Florida]
Around the table are the board of phase two. Morty and Jack sit beside each
other. Herb is chairing the meeting, and several other representatives are
present, some chatting with each other. Herb spots Mrs Choate coming in through
the door.

HERB
...There she is. Okay, if I can have your attention for a minute here.
We're calling this emergency meeting of the board of phase two, to consider a
motion of impeachment of our president, (indicating) Morty Seinfeld.
Mrs Choate sits beside Morty.

MORTY
Nervous, Jack?

JACK
What for?

MORTY
Because I have the votes.
Morty turns to Mrs Choate.

MORTY
Nice to see you, Mrs Choate.

MRS. CHOATE
Hello, Morty.
Jack looks surprised at the friendliness between Morty and Mrs Choate.

HERB
Building A. Are you for, or against, the motion to impeach?

RALPH
What does that mean?

HERB
It means, if you're for the motion, you're against Morty.

RALPH
So why don't you say that?

HERB
Hey, I'm running the meeting.

RALPH
If you think so.

HERB
Building A?

BUILDING A
For impeachment.

HERB
Building B?

BUILDING B
Against impeachment.

HERB
Building C?

BUILDING C
For impeachment.

HERB
Building D?

MRS. CHOATE
Against impeachment.

JACK
(a whisper to Morty) I can't believe you got that old bag.
Mrs Choate overhears Jack's comment, and it stirs a memory. She thinks back.
[New York Street, "The Rye"]
Jerry and Mrs Choate struggle for possession of a bag containing a marble rye.

MRS. CHOATE
Help! Someone help!

JERRY
Shut up, you old bag!
Jerry wrests the bag from Mrs Choate and takes off down the street.

MRS. CHOATE
(after Jerry) Oh, thief! Thief!
[Tenant's Committee, Florida]
Mrs Choate wears a look of shocked realisation. She stands and addresses Morty.

MRS. CHOATE
It's him. (pointing at Morty) It's your son. Now I know where I saw
him. He stole my marble rye.

MORTY
My son never stole anything. He's a good boy.

RALPH
They should lock him up.

MRS. CHOATE
(pointing at Morty) Like father, like son. (thumps table) I change
my vote. I vote to impeach!

BUILDING B
Me too. I change my vote.

HERB
All those in favour, say aye.

ALL (EXCEPT MORTY)
Aye.

HERB
All opposed.
Morty forlornly raises his hand.

HERB
The ayes have it. The motion passes.
Jack smiles a big smug smile of triumph, aimed at Morty.

HERB
Morty Seinfeld, you are officially dismissed as condo president. As
vice-president, Jack Klompus, in accordance with the phase two constitution, is
hereby installed as president.
Jack stands to acknowledge the honour.

HERB
Hear, hear, Jack.
Jack raises a hand in salute, as the rest of the board applaud him. A
disgruntled Morty remains silent.
[Hall Outside Jerry's Apartment]
A weary looking Nick, the cable guy, leans against Kramer's door. He knocks and
there's no response.

NICK
(weary) Alright, I know you're in there. I know you can hear me. You win,
okay? You win. I can't do it any more. What d'you want from me? Apology?
Alright, I'm sorry. There, I said it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I see now how we
made you feel when we made you sit home waiting. I dunno why we do it. (upset) I
guess maybe we just kind of enjoy taking advantage of people. (reasonable) Well,
that's gonna change. From now on, no more 'nine to twelve', no more 'one to
five'. We're gonna have appointments. Eleven o'clock is gonna mean eleven
o'clock. And, if we can't make it, we're gonna call you, tell you why. (worked
up) For god's sakes, if a doctor can do it, why can't we? (almost sobbing)
Anyway, that's it.
The cable guy sighs, and begins to walk away. Kramer's door opens, and Kramer
emerges. He and Nick look at each other apologetically for a few seconds. Then
Kramer steps forward and they hug.
[Morty and Helen's, Florida]
Morty comes in from the bedroom, looking around at his home. Helen holds his
coat as he slips into it. She adjusts his collar and hands him a blue hat. Jerry
enters through the front door.

JERRY
The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.
Jerry leads the way, followed by Helen, who folds a coat over her arm. Morty
waits a second or two, having a final look round the room. He stands by the
door, then steels himself. Giving a determined nod, he exits, closing the door
behind him.
[Outside Morty and Helen's, Florida]
The Seinfelds walk, three abreast, toward the Cadillac. As they walk, they pass
the other residents, who have come to see them off. They nod acknowledgement. As
they get to the car, Helen and Jerry get in, but Morty stands in the open door
of the Cadillac, turns to the assembled throng and gives a big smile, and
arms-wide gesture (like Nixon leaving the White House), before climbing into the
car. The residents wave back, one or two of them in tears, and Morty slowly
drives the Cadillac away.
End.
First scene.
Elaine in a doctor's office.

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may
not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission
for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna
knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.

DOCTOR
I'll need a urine sample.

ELAINE
Right.
 
New scene.
George, Jerry and Elaine in Jerry's apartment.

GEORGE
You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna
be simmering with boils.

ELAINE
Oh, Come on.

JERRY
Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?

GEORGE
Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?

JERRY
Yeah, sure. My parents will be there.

ELAINE
The Tonight Show?

JERRY
Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?

ELAINE
Are you doing new material?

JERRY
No.

ELAINE
I don't think so.
Kramer enters.

KRAMER
Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they
changed your shower head?

JERRY
No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.

KRAMER
Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
Kramer exits.

ELAINE
So what are your parents doing here in new York?

JERRY
Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father
left office in disgrace.

ELAINE
So what are their plans?

JERRY
Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development.
Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so
they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.

ELAINE
You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?

JERRY
No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved
in with her.

GEORGE
Uncle Leo's having regular sex?

JERRY
Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.

JERRY (ANSWERING PHONE)
Hello?

MORTY
Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show on Thursday.

JERRY
You gotta be there at 4:30.

MORTY
But it comes on 11:30.

JERRY
Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 11:30.

MORTY
How long they been doing this?

JERRY
30 years.

MORTY
Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?

JERRY
All right, I'll see you later.

ELAINE
Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?

GEORGE
Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?

JERRY
Yeah, it is.

GEORGE
I mean, they're retired.

JERRY
No economic reason for them to be here.

GEORGE
They have no friends.

JERRY
No social reason for them to be here.

ELAINE
You're all grown up.

GEORGE
Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they
still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back
to you.
George exits with the Del Boca Vista pamphlet.

JERRY (ANSWERING PHONE AGAIN)
Hello?

HELEN
Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.

JERRY
I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?

HELEN
I can do that.

JERRY
You know Dad just called me.

HELEN
Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up.

JERRY
Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.

HELEN
Ok.

JERRY
All right, bye. (to Elaine): You see this? Any thought pops into their
head they're calling me because it's a local call now.

ELAINE
Ahh.

JERRY
I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got
the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!

ELAINE
They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?

JERRY
The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has
to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.

ELAINE
How's that gonna happen?
 
New scene.
Jerry and Uncle Leo at Monk's coffee shop.

UNCLE LEO
It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to do this once a
week.

JERRY (TO HIMSELF)
Once a week? So how's Lydia?

UNCLE LEO
Ah, she's a real tiger.

JERRY
I don't know how you do it.

UNCLE LEO
What?

JERRY
A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's
none of my business.

UNCLE LEO
What are you talking about?

JERRY
Well...

UNCLE LEO
Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium.

JERRY
Hey, it happens.

UNCLE LEO
I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.

JERRY
He has no idea who you are.

UNCLE LEO
They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry.

JERRY
All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your
hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon
Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked
in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin,
you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you
I'd tell this Lydia character, "It's been real," move back into that bachelor
pad and put out a sign; Open for business.

UNCLE LEO
Believe me, I thought about it. But she is so perfect in every way,
I can't see a flaw.

JERRY
Well, keep looking.
New scene.
Elaine and Mr. Peterman at work.

PETERMAN
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you will not be
accompanying me to Africa.

ELAINE
What? Why not?

PETERMAN
I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive for opium.

ELAINE
Opium?

PETERMAN
That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai Sally.

ELAINE
Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz
must have made a mistake.

PETERMAN
Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone else to
accompany me on my journey. The dark continent is no place for an addict,
Elaine.

ELAINE
Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I
don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right
now, I'll take a pop urine test.

PETERMAN
All right, Elaine.

ELAINE
Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready
in three minutes.
New scene.
George and his parents at their home in Queens.

GEORGE
Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh.
Bitter cold, bitter.

FRANK
I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities.

ESTELLE
What extremities?

GEORGE
You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine.
That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is
eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.

ESTELLE
So George, why are you here?

GEORGE
What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table)

ESTELLE
What's this.

GEORGE
That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep.
You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean
up.

ESTELLE
I don't bet.

GEORGE
What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.

ESTELLE
I don't swim.

GEORGE
You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the
sidewalks.

ESTELLE
Are you trying to get rid of us?

GEORGE
Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away
 
New scene.
Elaine, back in the doctor's office. The doctor is consulting a chart and
shaking his head no.

ELAINE
No?
The doctor hands Elaine the chart, she looks at it in astonishment.
 
New scene.
Jerry's apartment. Kramer walks in, his trademark 'high hair' is flat.

KRAMER
Jerry? Jerry!
Jerry walks in from the back room, his hair is also flat.

KRAMER
Wha, you too?

JERRY
Yeah!

KRAMER
These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the
shampoo out of my hair.

JERRY
Me either.

KRAMER
If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and
ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.

JERRY
You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to
shower in the dressing room.

KRAMER (LEAVING)
Aw.

JERRY
Where are you going?

KRAMER
I gotta find another shower.
 
New scene.
Hallway outside Newman's apartment. Kramer knocks on Newman's door. Newman
answers, with flat hair.

KRAMER
They got you too?

NEWMAN
This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!
Kramer backs away then runs down the hall.
 
New scene.
Elaine's office, Kramer rushes in.

KRAMER
Oh, Elaine. Yeah.

ELAINE
Kramer, you look terrible.

KRAMER
Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.

ELAINE
What's wrong with your shower?

KRAMER
There's no water pressure.

ELAINE
Why don't you just go see Jerry?
Just as Kramer is about to answer, Mr. Peterman walks past Elaine's open office
door and pauses.

KRAMER
Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know
who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs
crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.

PETERMAN (BUSTING IN)
Not on my watch! (Grabs Kramer by the collar) I won't
have you turning my office into a den of iniquity! Get your fix somewhere else!
(Throws Kramer out and slams the door closed)

ELAINE
Mr Peterman! What are you doing?

PETERMAN
Elaine, you're out of control. You need help.

ELAINE
Huh?

PETERMAN
I know what you're going through. I too once fell under the spell of
opium. It was 1979. I was travelling the Yangtzee in search of a Mongolian
horsehair vest. I had got to the market after sundown, all of the clothing
traders had gone, but a different sort of trader still lurked about. "Just a
taste," he said. That was all it took.
 

ELAINE
Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to
anything.

PETERMAN
Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous one.

THE PRICE? YOUR SOUL. OH, AND BY THE WAY, YOU HAVE TIL' 5
0 to clear out your
desk. You're fired.
 
New scene.
Jerry's dressing room at NBC. Jerry and his parents are there.

HELEN
All they serve is chicken?

JERRY
There's more food down the hall.

MORTY
Wrap it up, we'll take it home.
George walks in with his parents.

JERRY
Oh, hi.

ESTELLE
Hello Seinfelds.

MORTY
Hello.

HELEN
Hi.

FRANK
This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.

ESTELLE
Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so nervous for
you.

JERRY
Actually, I'm drunk.

GEORGE
Hey, hey, how was Florida?

MORTY
Well, we just bought a new place down there.

ESTELLE
I know, we were looking at the brochure.

MORTY
What?

HELEN
Why, you thinking of moving?

FRANK
Not really.

MORTY
Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available in that
development.

FRANK
Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all of Del Boca
Vista?

MORTY
That's right. They went like hotcakes.

FRANK
How'd you get yours?

MORTY
Got lucky.

FRANK
Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!

JERRY
I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps
conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little
personal space.
New scene.
Monk's coffee shop, Elaine is at the counter eating a muffin and talking with a
waitress.

ELAINE
How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand,
that's a mistake. But twice?

WAITRESS
Yeah, it's hard to figure.

ELAINE
I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the
bushmen of the Kalahari.

WAITRESS
Ah, the bushmen?

ELAINE
And the bushwomen.

MAN (ALSO SEATED AT THE COUNTER)
Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing. I
notice you're eating a poppy seed muffin.

ELAINE
Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.

MAN
Well, you know what opium is made from...

ELAINE (AS THOUGH RECEIVING A REVELATION)
Poppies!
 
New scene.
Jerry is on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

JAY
Welcome back. Talking with Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry, lemme ask you, I saw
some people back there, they look like.. family? Is that family?

JERRY
Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're
crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching
Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other
day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on
anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an
anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get
a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.
New scene.
Jerry's apartment. Jerry is on the phone.

JERRY
Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of
the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an
anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment.
You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What?
What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Kramer walks in wearing a bathrobe, his hair is still flat.

JERRY
Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't
that great?

KRAMER (HALFHEARTEDLY)
Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.

JERRY
Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?

KRAMER
I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?

JERRY
No good?

KRAMER
It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth.
All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.

JERRY
Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?

KRAMER
Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.

JERRY (OFFERING A PLATE)
Chicken?

KRAMER
Oh, yeah.
Elaine enters.

ELAINE
Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing
positive for opium. Poppy seeds!

JERRY
Poppy seeds!

KRAMER
Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken?

ELAINE
Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll
get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.
There's a knock at the door, Jerry answers it, it's Newman.

JERRY
Hello Newman.

NEWMAN
Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little problem.
Elaine, would you excuse us?

ELAINE
Oh c'mon, Newman.

NEWMAN
I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. (Opens
door) If you don't mind?

ELAINE
Jerry?

NEWMAN
Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it!
(Pushes Elaine out the door and closes it) All right, now here's the lowdown.
From a certain connection, I've been able to locate some black market shower
heads. They're all made in the former Yugoslavia, and from what I hear the
Serbs are fanatic about their showers.

JERRY
Not from the footage I've seen.

NEWMAN
Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market Diner, an
unmarked van will be waiting. I'm expecting the call at any time. Are you in?

KRAMER
I'm down.

NEWMAN
Jerry?
Jerry nods reluctantly.
 
New scene.
Frank and Estelle's house.

ESTELLE
So, Georgie, we have some big news for you.

GEORGE
Big news?

ESTELLE
We're moving to Florida.

GEORGE (ECSTATIC)
What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm
so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this
cold weather for?

FRANK
Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the Seinfelds.

GEORGE
What do you mean?

FRANK
They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right into Del
Boca Vista!

GEORGE
So you're moving there for spite!

FRANK
Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!

GEORGE
That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!

ESTELLE
So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?

GEORGE
Oh, every chance I get.

ESTELLE (WARMLY)
Ohhh.
 
New scene.
George busts into Jerry's apartment.

GEORGE
Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting!

JERRY
What's going on?

GEORGE
My parents are moving to Florida!

JERRY
Are you kidding?

GEORGE
Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm
free!!

JERRY
Where are they moving to?

GEORGE
Del Boca Vista!

JERRY
Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!

GEORGE
I know!

JERRY
We could visit together!

GEORGE
Every five years!
They 'high five' each other.

JERRY
That's incredible!

GEORGE
I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?

JERRY
Why?

GEORGE
To spite your parents!

JERRY
To spite my parents?

GEORGE
Yeah!

JERRY
Your parents are crazy!

GEORGE
I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!

JERRY
My parents are moving back too!

GEORGE
Beautiful!
 
New scene.
Helen and Morty, packing up in Uncle Leo's apartment.

MORTY
I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back to Florida.

HELEN
He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?
Morty shrugs, the phone rings, Morty answers.

MORTY
Hello?

VOICE
This is Frank Costanza.

MORTY
What do you want?

FRANK
You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving in lock, stock
and barrel. We're gonna be in the pool. We're gonna be in the clubhouse.
We're gonna be all over that shuffleboard court! And I dare you to keep me out!
Frank hangs up, Morty hangs up.

MORTY
I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida.
 
New scene.
Jerry's apartment, Jerry and George are toasting their good fortune.

GEORGE
I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.

JERRY
You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this.
Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self
confidence than you ever dreamed of.
The phone rings, Jerry answers.

JERRY
Hello.

MORTY
Hello, Jerry? It's your father.

JERRY
Oh, hi dad.

MORTY
Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little while?
Sounds of breaking glass, Jerry dropped his bottle.

MORTY
What was that?

JERRY
Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna
move in here?

MORTY
Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.

JERRY
But it's a big complex.

MORTY
You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone.

JERRY
All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)

GEOPRGE
What?

JERRY
They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.

GEORGE
What? Why?

JERRY
Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went
from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.

GEORGE
Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn
to live, baby.

JERRY
You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent
Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.
 
New scene.
Monk's coffee shop, Jerry and Uncle Leo are sharing a booth.

LEO
Move back with Lydia?

JERRY
C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody.

LEO
Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging.

JERRY
Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're
disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from
your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your
presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like
grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.

LEO
But she's an anti-Semite.

JERRY
Can you blame her?
 
New scene.
Helen and Morty are unpacking in Jerry's apartment.

HELEN
You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?

MORTY
Why would he mind? We're his parents.
Elaine walks in picking her teeth, she didn't expect to see Jerry's parents.

ELAINE
Oh.

HELEN
Hi Elaine.

ELAINE
Hello. Jerry's not here?

HELEN
No.

ELAINE
Huh. (pause) Oh my god.

HELEN
What?

ELAINE
A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm
going to the doctor's in a half an hour.

HELEN
Why?

ELAINE
It's a long story.

HELEN
Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom.

ELAINE
What are you gonna do in there?

HELEN
What am I gonna do in the bathroom?

ELAINE
You gotta do me a favor.

HELEN
Elaine, I really--

ELAINE
Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.

HELEN
You want my urine?

ELAINE
I need a clean urine sample from a woman.

HELEN
I don't know.

ELAINE
Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?

HELEN
Well, what am I gonna do it in?

ELAINE
Well, one of those glasses.

HELEN
Jerry's glasses?

ELAINE
Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.
Helen, Oh, I could uh-- Should I use a coffee cup?

ELAINE
Yeah, a coffee cup's fine.

HELEN
Or maybe a juice glass.

ELAINE
Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.

HELEN
This one is kind of scratched.

ELAINE
It doesn't matter.

HELEN
Howbout A milk glass.

ELAINE
A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.

HELEN
Jerry doesn't wash these very well.

ELAINE
Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!

All right, I got everything here. I got the Cyclone F series, Hydra
Jet Flow, Stockholm Superstream, you name it.

JERRY
What do you recommend?

SALESMAN
What are you looking for?

KRAMER
Power, man. Power.

NEWMAN
Like Silkwood.

KRAMER
That's for radiation.

NEWMAN
That's right.

KRAMER (POINTING TO THE LARGEST ONE)
Now, what is this?

SALESMAN
That's the Commando 450, I don't sell that one. What about thi-

KRAMER
Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.
Salesman, Nah, believe me. It's only used in the circus. For elephants.

NEWMAN
We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money to Kramer)
What about Jerry?

KRAMER
He couldn't handle that, he's delicate.
 
New scene.
Helen and Morty are unpacking in Uncle Leo's apartment.

HELEN
It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.

MORTY
First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's going on?
There's a knock at the door.

MORTY
Who is it?

SUPER
It's the super. We're installing new low-flow showerheads in all the
bathrooms.

MORTY
Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.
 
New scene.
Mr. Peterman, in his office, on the telephone.

PETERMAN
So as a result of your test being free of opium, I am reinstating you.

ELAINE
Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?

PETERMAN
I'm afraid I can't take you.

ELAINE
What? Why not?

PETERMAN
Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. you
have the metabolism of a sixty-eight year old woman.

ELAINE
But I wanted to see the bushmen.

PETERMAN
Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis.

Jerry is seeing his parents off as the cab driver loads their bags. They have
flat hair.

JERRY
Well, it's been a great visit.

MORTY
Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to
Florida is take a shower.

JERRY
Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move.
They couldn't bear being away from George.

HELEN
George must be happy about that.

JERRY
You have no idea.
 
New scene.
George's parents' house, George is sitting on the couch between Frank and
Estelle, he's obviously disappointed.

FRANK
Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.

ESTELLE
What does he want with your swim trunks?

FRANK
Why should they go to waste?!?
 
New scene.
Kramer, in the shower, he's got the Commando 450 shower head hooked up. He
turns it on, the water shoots out full blast and knocks him backwards. He grabs
the shower curtain for support and tries to reach forward to turn the faucet
off, but the force of the water is too great, he only succeeds in knocking over
a few shampoo bottles. Kramer is eventually pushed back enough by the water to
become entangled in the shower curtain until he eventually falls out of the
shower, and out of camera range.
End.

Night club]
(Jerry is just now getting done with his act)

JERRY
Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)

SALLY
Jerry!

JERRY
(Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey!

SALLY
(Reminding him who she is) Sally Weaver! (Sees Jerry's expression - he still has no clue who she is) Susan Ross' roommate from college.. hello! (Laughs slightly)

JERRY
Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?

SALLY
Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are so funny.

JERRY
(Modest) Oh, thanks.

SALLY
(Serious) No, no, I mean it. You're very funny.

JERRY
(Blunt) I believe you.

SALLY
Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis. I am taking you (Points to him) out to dinner.

JERRY
(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.

SALLY
Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I guess because we're both wacko! (Jerry laughs) You know what, um.. (Turns around, picking up a large gift from a table) You have to give this to them for me. Okay? Here. (Hands the box to Jerry, he struggles under the size of it) It's a wedding present.

JERRY
Oh?

SALLY
And Jerry? Be careful with it, okay? Be very careful.

JERRY
Uh-huh.

[SETTING
The Coffee shop]
(George and his father, Frank, are sitting at a booth)

FRANK
George, as you may be aware, your mother and I are not moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.

GEORGE
(Resenting the fact. Nodding) I am aware.

FRANK
So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into a billiard parlor?

GEORGE
A billiard parlor?

FRANK
Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity..
(Elaine enters. George spots her in mid-sentence)

GEORGE
Well, that's.. Elaine!

ELAINE
Oh, hi, Frank.

GEORGE
(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.

ELAINE
(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.

GEORGE
(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.

ELAINE
(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?

GEORGE
(Confused) What photo?

ELAINE
You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?

FRANK
(Interested) There's a Costanza in Tuscany? (Elaine nods) Did he look like me? Did you talk to him?

ELAINE
I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.

FRANK
I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo.

ELAINE
Who is that?

GEORGE
(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.

FRANK
I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we separated.

ELAINE
So, you weren't born here?

FRANK
No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse to vote. (Yelling out) They don't want me, I don't want them!

GEORGE
I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-

FRANK
(Cutting him off) Don't bring me down. (To Elaine) Do you have another copy of that photo?

ELAINE
No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.

FRANK
The Maestro? What Maestro?

ELAINE
He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.

GEORGE
Really? Why?

ELAINE
(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.

GEORGE
Who?

ELAINE
You know the Three Tenors?

GEORGE
Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.

ELAINE
(Nodding) The other guy.

[SETTING
Airplane]
(Jerry's flying to NY. On his lap is Sally's present and his personal bag. He's trying to read a magazine while a stewardess approaches him)

STEWARDESS
(Overly nice) Could I take that box for you?

JERRY
Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.

STEWARDESS
Oh, then, I'll have to put your bag in the over-head.

JERRY
Oh, okay..
(The stewardess takes the bag, and crams it into the over-head compartment. The sound of glass breaking can be heard)

STEWARDESS
There we go.
(Jerry gives a face of pure dissatisfaction)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Jerry's apartment]
(Kramer enters while Jerry's unpacking. The clothes in his suitcase are covered in bar-b-que sauce)

JERRY
Ohh.. look at this..

KRAMER
What?

JERRY
I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this (Gestures to Sally's present) stupid thing.

KRAMER
Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..

JERRY
I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.

KRAMER
(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..

JERRY
No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.

KRAMER
Well, why don't you do your material?

JERRY
I'm out.

KRAMER
(Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work.

JERRY
(Sarcastic) Thanks for the tip.
(George enters)

GEORGE
Hey, buddies.

JERRY
Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.

GEORGE
Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.

JERRY
(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?

KRAMER
(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread)
(George is still opening the gift - flinging Styrofoam peanuts all over the table)

JERRY
(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

KRAMER
(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?

JERRY
Like what?

KRAMER
Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"

JERRY
(Confused) Where's the punchline?

KRAMER
It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)

GOERGE
(Taking out a mat from the huge box) Well, this is certainly a crappy gift..

JERRY
A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!

GEORGE
Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.

JERRY
Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!

KRAMER
Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) "The Costanzas"

GEORGE
No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.

KRAMER
Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.

GEORGE
I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.

KRAMER
(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
George's old bedroom]
(The room is remodeled into a billiard room. The pool table is obviously way too big for the room. Frank and Kramer are chalking up their sticks)

KRAMER
So, what's your game? What do you like to play?

FRANK
Eight ball.

KRAMER
No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?

FRANK
You like to gamble, Cosmo?

KRAMER
Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..

FRANK
Five dollars a game, huh?

KRAMER
I'll break.

FRANK
Okay.

Oh, I'm just moving in some more of my stuff.

GEORGE
(Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..

SUSAN
(Calling out) Oh, I put up my doll collection..
(George walks into his room, and stops in his tracks. Up on the shelves, is a doll that looks exactly like George's mother)

GEORGE
Oh my God! What is that?!

SUSAN
(Rushing in) What? What is it?

GEORGE
(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.

I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!

ESTELLE
What's going on in here? (Kramer hits the cue ball, it jumps up from the table and flies off screen) Are you two still playing?! You've been up here three hours!

FRANK
We still haven't finished the first game.

ESTELLE
The first game?!

KRAMER
(Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.

FRANK
(To Estelle) he knows the Maestro. He could have the picture..

ESTELLE
Oh, forget about it. It's not your cousin.

FRANK
(Yelling out) You don't know that! (Estelle leaves, slamming the door) We're gonna go see him, huh?

KRAMER
(Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over..

FRANK
(Sensing the game is going to last a long time) Oh boy.

KRAMER
Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
George and Susan's bedroom]
(George and Susan are in bed. They go to kiss, but George stops when he sees the doll laying right next to Susan)

GEORGE
What is this thing doing here?

SUSAN
Oh, I used to love to sleep with my dolls when I was a little girl..
(Susan leans in to kiss, but George stops her again)

GEORGE
Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this..

SUSAN
Why?

GEORGE
I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.

SUSAN
Oh, stop it.
(They kiss. While kissing, George tightly stuffs the doll under Susan's pillow -- out of sight)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Jerry's apartment]
(Jerry enters the living room from his bathroom with his toothbrush. Elaine is reading the paper at his table)

JERRY
Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.

ELAINE
(Just making conversation) Oh yeah?

JERRY
Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!

ELAINE
(Mock enthusiasm) Oh, that's dynamite.

JERRY
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?

ELAINE
Who else is on the show?

JERRY
Uh.. one of the three tenors.

ELAINE
(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!

JERRY
Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..

ELAINE
(Extremely excited) The other guy?!

JERRY
(Nodding) Yeah, the other guy.

ELAINE
(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!

JERRY
Why?

ELAINE
Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?

JERRY
Why not?

ELAINE
(Extremely giddy) Wow! The other guy!
(George enters. He's in a disheveled state)

JERRY
Hey, you look awful.

GEORGE
(Sitting on the sofa) I'm on no sleep, bro.

JERRY
Problem in the bedroom?

GEORGE
(Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.
(Elaine makes a face)

JERRY
Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?

GEORGE
(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.

JERRY
I thought you didn't want the doormat.

GEORGE
I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.

JERRY
Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?

GEORGE
Yeah, (Smiling) Susan said you'd be excited.

JERRY
Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!

ELAINE
Who's Sally?

GEORGE
Susan's college roommate.

JERRY
It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.

GEORGE
So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.

JERRY
(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!

ELAINE
That's sounds pretty juvenile.

JERRY
(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
The Maestro's Office]
(Kramer and Frank are in a meeting with the Maestro)

FRANK
His name was Carlo Costanza. We played together everyday until I was four. If I could just look through your photographs, maybe I could recognize him.

MAESTRO
Unfortunately those photographs are at home.

KRAMER
Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.

FRANK
(Trying to concentrate) Yes, It's, uh, it's.. uh, uh.. What do you call it, Kramer?

KRAMER
A billiard room.

FRANK
No, not billiard.. (Scolding) Not billiards.. it was.. Come on, already. Come on..

KRAMER
(Confused) What?

FRANK
We call it.. the, uh..

KRAMER
(Snaps) The Place To Be!

FRANK
The place to be! Yes! It's the place to be.

MAESTRO
(Agreeing to a game) Ah, then I shall be there. And now, Gentlemen, (Making dramatic actions) if you will excuse me - I must prepare for the symphony.

KRAMER
Oh, yeah?
(The Maestro gets up. Realizing that he isn't wearing pants, Kramer and Frank stare in bewilderment)

MAESTRO
(Noticing the expressions) Ohh, my pants. (Begins putting on a near-by pair of pants) It's an old conductor's trick I learned from Leonard Bernstein.

KRAMER
Really?

MAESTRO
You keep a perfect crease by not sitting in them before the performance.
(Kramer and Frank are obviously impressed)

KRAMER
That's good thinking.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Jerry's apartment]
(George, presenting the doll to Jerry, has his arms out in a 'tada' gesture. Jerry has on a disgusted face)

GEORGE
You see?.. You see?!

JERRY
Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.

GEORGE
Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!

JERRY
Why don't you just get rid of it?

GEORGE
I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing.

JERRY
Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
(George shoots him a look, then leaves. He is audible as he meets up with Elaine in the hallway)

GEORGE
Hi, Elaine.
(Elaine shrieks out in fright, then enters Jerry's doorway - breathless)

ELAINE
Did you see that?!

JERRY
I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)

ELAINE
Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.

JERRY
Oh. (Intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it) Yeah?

SALLY
(Through the intercom) It's Sally.

JERRY
Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?

SALLY
A whole case.

JERRY
(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?

ELAINE
(Blunt, to the point) No.

JERRY
How come? I told you - It's fantastic.

ELAINE
Eh, I like mine.

JERRY
I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?

ELAINE
I don't want it.

JERRY
(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.

ELAINE
(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.
(A knock on the door)

JERRY
Come in.
(Sally enters with a medium-sized box)

SALLY
(Peppy) Well, here I am!

JERRY
Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.

ELAINE
Hi.

JERRY
How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?

SALLY
(Setting the box down on his table) Actually, the seat next to me was empty, so, there was no problem at all.

JERRY
(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!

SALLY
That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. "The Pride of Memphis!"

JERRY
(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!

SALLY
This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other sauce as (Whispering) kind of a joke.

JERRY
I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!

SALLY
You could just do your material.

JERRY
(Peeved) I don't have any material!

ELAINE
(Yelling out) He's got nothin'!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
The Coffee Shop]
(George is sitting at the table - opposite the doll. While he eats his meal, he can hear his mother yelling at him via the doll)

DOLL
Georgie! Don't eat with your hands! (George starts eating faster) Why do you eat so fast?! You can't even taste it!

GEORGE
(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
(People from near-by tables turn and look at him)

DOLL
You're wearing that shirt? You've had it for five years already! Why don't you get a new shirt?!

GEORGE
(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out)

WOMAN
(To Ruthie, the cashier) That man should really be in a sanitarium. (Ruthie nods, agreeing)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
George's old bedroom]
(The Maestro, Kramer, and Frank are all pant-less and playing pool while listening to classical music. Frank is looking at the Maestro's pictures with a magnifying glass)

KRAMER
Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.

FRANK
It's him! (Standing up) It's Carlo Costanza!

KRAMER
Come on. Are you sure?
(They all crowd around the picture)

FRANK
I'd know him anywhere.

MAESTRO
I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation of being kind of a village idiot.

FRANK
I still say we're related.

MAESTRO
(Recognizing the currently playing song) Ohh, I love this piece. (Turns it up, then pantomimes that he is conducting the instruments)

KRAMER
Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot.

FRANK
(Complaining) I can't make anything..

KRAMER
(Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.

FRANK
Follow through? What do you mean?

KRAMER
Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..
(Estelle walks in with a tray of beverages and popcorn. Kramer and Frank continue the lesson in their underwear as she stares in disbelief)

FRANK
It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it.

ESTELLE
Oh, my God!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
Jerry's apartment]

JERRY
(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.

ELAINE
Well, have you ever considered writing new material?

JERRY
Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.

ELAINE
(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?

JERRY
(Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here.

ELAINE
(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?

JERRY
Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.

ELAINE
What?

JERRY
Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.
(Scene cuts to George's apartment. Sally answers the ringing phone)

SALLY
Hello?

JERRY
Hello, Susan? It's Jerry.

SALLY
Hi Jerry, it's Sally!

JERRY
(Disappointed) Oh. Is George there?

SALLY
No, but he should be home soon.

JERRY
Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.

SALLY
Is this for your comedy routine?

JERRY
(Obviously resents talking to her) Yes.

SALLY
(Gasps) Don't worry. (Like a detective) I'm on the case.
(Jerry makes a face of doubt as he hangs up)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
George's old bedroom]
(The same pool game is going on. The Maestro is putting his pants on)

MAESTRO
(Sighs slightly) I, uh, think I'll get some air. (Slowly leaves)

KRAMER
Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going..
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
The Charles Grodin Show dressing room]
(Elaine enters)

ELAINE AND JERRY
Hey!

ELAINE
Is George here?

JERRY
Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
(Elaine gasps. Smiling, she walks over to him)

ELAINE
It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?

CARRERAS
My pleasure. (Reaches for a pen as Elaine unravels her poster)

ELAINE
(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.

JERRY
(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!

ELAINE
(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?

JERRY
Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.

ELAINE
(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?

JERRY
Well, I want to sit down.

ELAINE
So?

JERRY
It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
George's old bedroom]
(The game is over)

MAESTRO
(Making his exit, he lays the charm on Mrs. Costanza) Madame, you have been an extremely gracious hostess. (Kisses her hand)

ESTELLE
(Coy) Ohh.. thank you, Maestro. (Giggles to herself as the Maestro leaves)

FRANK
(Holding up a picture) Here, take a look at this.

ESTELLE
(Looking at it) Yeah, what is it?

FRANK
It's Carlo. I found him!

ESTELLE
(Handing the picture back) You've been cooped up in this room too long.

FRANK
(Yelling out) You never support me! Let's see what George says about this.. Where're my pants? (Takes his pair off a rack and leaves)

KRAMER
(Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
The Charles Grodin Show dressing room]
(Sally walks in with a bag. Jerry's sitting without any pants on)

SALLY
Hey there, Mr. Hairy legs!

JERRY
(Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?

SALLY
Don't worry, I brought your doll.. (Pulls out an extremely different doll - this one resembles a baker) Tada!

JERRY
(Complaining) No! That's the wrong doll!

SALLY
Jerry, I saw the doll you were talking about - not funny! This doll's much funnier. Look, it has a little bowtie, and a cute little hat.. I think it's a riot!

JERRY
(Slow whispering) This is a nightmare.

SALLY
Oh well, I'll be watching. (Sets the doll down, then crosses her fingers) Don't screw up. (Leaves)
(View shifts over to Carreras. While eating some BBQ food he reaches back for a towel to wipe his face. He happens upon Jerry's pants) Too much sauce.. (Wipes his mouth)

JERRY
My pants!
(A stagehand enters)

STAGEHAND
Mr. Seinfeld, you're on.
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
NYC street]
(Elaine's walking down with the poster and the box. A man exiting an ice cream parlor almost runs into her. Scene cuts to her on the subway. The man standing next to her is bumped, and his beverage spills all over Elaine. Luckily, she held the poster up before it could be damaged. Scene cuts to the Maestro's office)

MAESTRO
Elaine? What a surprise.

ELAINE
I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.

MAESTRO
Ohh.. (Looking at the box) Ori-dent - that electric toothbrush I've heard so much about..

ELAINE
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.
(The Maestro takes the poster, dramatically rolling the rubber band off. He unravels the poster on his desk)

MAESTRO
Ohh, what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite tenor, with.. those two other guys. Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico!

ELAINE
Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..

STAGEHAND
(Yelling from off-camera) Maestro, you're on!

MAESTRO
Oh, Elaine.. wait for me after the concert? We'll celebrate.

ELAINE
Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster)
(Scene cuts to the Maestro's concert. Various players are practicing as he walks out. A round of applause sounds as the Maestro bows. Picking up his bent baton, he addresses the orchestra. As he starts to instruct the band, he stops when he finds out his baton is bent out of shape. He turns and looks at the audience apologetically as the music fades to a stop)
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
George and Susan's apartment]
(Susan's holding her doll defensively)

SUSAN
I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.

GEORGE
I just wanted a second opinion.
(There's a knock at the door. George sighs, then answers it - it's Frank)

FRANK
(Holding up the picture) Take a look at this. Doesn't that look like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother- (His attention is drawn over to Susan's doll. Like George did earlier, he starts to imagine that the doll is scolding him as his wife would)

DOLL
Oh, stop bothering everybody with that picture. It's ridiculous!

FRANK
(Walking toward the doll) Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous! (Struggles with Susan for possession of the doll) Come here!

SUSAN
(Pleading) No, Mr. Costanza! No, no!
(Frank manages to get the doll from Susan. He twists the head clean off the body)

FRANK
(Holding out the head in his hand, he addresses it) There! Now what have you got to say for yourself?!

GEORGE
(To Susan) I told you it looked like her..
(Scene ends)

[SETTING
A street in Tuscany]
(Frank meets up with a man sweeping the sidewalk - the man he believes to be his cousin)

FRANK
(Sets a gift he's brought down) Carlo! It's me, Frank! (Attempts to hug the guy, but he resists - pushing Frank away. He scolds Frank in another language) I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?

MAN
Carlo? No. Mi nome e Giuseppe.

FRANK
(Realizing) What do you know.. Alright. (Picking up his present) I guess I was wrong. (Walks off)
(Scene ends)
End.
[Nightclub]
Jerry's opening monologue.

JERRY
The other thing I love is when you're in the middle of a dream, and
the alarm goes off. You incorporate the sound of the alarm into the dream, so
you can keep sleeping. And you'll make any adjustment in the dream to do it.
I was with Marie Antoinette in a dream last night, and she was on the
guillotine, the blade came down, her head fell into the basket, it rolled
over and she started singing Neil Diamond's 'Solitary Man'. And, I thought,
"That is not my alarm going off. This is actually happening."
[Street, New York]
An elated George leaps around the corner, kicking a cab's door closed and
clapping his hands together.

GEORGE
(joyful) June. It's June.
George begins trotting down the street. He acknowledges a passerby and
high-fives him.

GEORGE
(high-fiving) Hey!
George continues his joyful path along the sidewalk, with his hands raised
above his head in celebration.

GEORGE
It's June.    
George takes the hand of a female passerby and dances a few steps with her,
twirling her round.

GEORGE
June, June, June.
Releasing the woman, George euphorically prances along, laughing and smiling.

GEORGE
(to passerby) Hey, he-hah. It's June, June.
George leaps onto the footing of a streetlight and spins on it, in
time-honoured musical fashion.

GEORGE
It's Juu-uu-une! Hey hay. Yes.
George leaps from the streetlight onto the road, where he spreads his arms
and spins.

GEORGE
I love Juu-uuu-uu-uune!
A car brakes behind George and sounds its horn. George flinches, and jigs
nervously out from in front of the automobile and back to the pavement.
[Jerry's Apartment]
George pushes open the door and enters, still ebullient. He punches the air
as he looks to Jerry.

GEORGE
June. Juune, baby!

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's
like a stay of execution.

JERRY
Dead man walking.

GEORGE
(pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky
day.

JERRY
Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.

GEORGE
Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's
best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.

JERRY
She did?

GEORGE
Yeah.

JERRY
So? Wheels?

GEORGE
In motion. The wheels are in motion.

JERRY
Beautiful.

GEORGE
Aah, hey. (enthusiastic) If this works out, forget about it.
Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost as good
as if I didn't get married.

JERRY
So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.

GEORGE
The Friars Club?

JERRY
Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for
membership.
Kramer opens the door and leans in.

KRAMER
Hey everybody. (to Jerry) Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got
a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty
minutes, alright?

JERRY
Catnap?

KRAMER
No, no, no, no. (comes in) This is evolutionary. I been reading this
book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?

JERRY
(deadpan) That must be some book.

KRAMER
Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every
three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake
per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived
the equivalent of a hundred and five years.

JERRY
Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.

KRAMER
Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.
Kramer heads for the door.

JERRY
I didn't know you had a hopper.

KRAMER
(smiling) Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.
Kramer exits, closing the door behind him.
[Conference Room, J. Peterman]
A number of executives are seated round a table, with J Peterman at the head
of the table.

PETERMAN
Alright, people, I'd like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met
good fellow, to Bob Grossberg, who's joining us from Business Affairs.
Peterman indicates a guy sitting next to Elaine. The other executives give
Bob some quiet applause, which he acknowledges with a slight wave.

BOB
Thanks. Hi everybody.

PETERMAN
Bob, we have a little baptism by fire for you, so to speak.
Elaine leans over to the guy sitting on the other side of her from Bob.

ELAINE
(whispers) Poor bastard.

PETERMAN
(to Bob) I want you to handle all the fact-checking and the
copy-editing for the new catalogue.
Bob looks blank and fiddles with something behind his ear.

BOB
Ah, could you repeat that?

PETERMAN
(slower and louder) Why don't you handle all the copy-editing?
Bob pulls a face and points to indicate all is not well with his hearing.

BOB
(apologetic) I..I'm sorry. What?

PETERMAN
(louder still) Copy-editing!
Peterman sees he's not getting through to Bob, and gives up.

PETERMAN
Eh, never mind. (turns to Elaine) Elaine, you do it.
Elaine does a double-take at hearing this, looking dismayed. Bob has a
hearing aid out of his ear and manipulates it before slipping it back in.
[Friars Club Lobby]
Jerry, George, Susan, and Hallie stand before the maitre d' of the rather
fancy Friars Club. Jerry has no jacket

JERRY
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.

MAITRE D'
Yes, Mr Seinfeld, but uhm, all gentlemen are required to wear
jackets in the dining room.

JERRY
(downcast) Oh, I'm sorry.

HALLIE
(smiling) How embarrassing this must be for you.

JERRY
(jocular) You just bought your own dinner.
George, Susan and Hallie laugh at his little joke.

MAITRE D'
No problem. Please, follow me.
The maitre d' strides away, Jerry follows.

JERRY
(passing Hallie) 'Scuse me.

GEORGE
(smiling) Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha.
A couple of people walk by, George raises a hand in greeting.

GEORGE
Friars.
Jerry returns, wearing a blazer, with a crest on the breast pocket.

JERRY
Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing here.
George, Susan and Hallie, all make positive noises and comments. The maitre
d' comes up behind Jerry and motions them to enter.

MAITRE D'
This way please.

GEORGE
Hup, here we go. Here we go.
The four of them walk on into the restaurant, with George bringing up the
rear.
[Friars Club Restaurant]
Jerry, George, Susan and Hallie, sit round a table, eating. They're engage in
at least two separate conversations - Jerry with George and Susan with
Hallie.

GEORGE
(adamant) Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's
not that hard
Jerry looks scornfully at George.

SUSAN
(to Hallie) Mmm, mm, mm. Hallie (points to her plate) taste this fish.
It's really delicious.
Hallie spears a morsel from Susan's plate and eats it.

JERRY
(to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.

GEORGE
(to Jerry) Oh, get outta here.

JERRY
(to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest
thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the
same guy from *Seals and Croft*.

HALLIE
(to Susan) Mmm, it is good.

SUSAN
(to Hallie) What do you think about having fish for the wedding?

GEORGE
(to Jerry) You watch the old videos. (insistent) I'm telling you,
look at him.

HALLIE
(to Susan) Oh. Remember (indistinct) wedding?

JERRY
Oh, come on.

GEORGE
Look...

JERRY
Alright.
The four continue chatting happily.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Kramer is asleep on Jerry's couch. Jerry enters, wearing a long coat.

JERRY
(looking at Kramer) This is nice.
Jerry slams the door and Kramer jerks awake.

KRAMER
Yeah, morning.

JERRY
Morning?
Jerry removes his coat, to reveal he's wearing the crested jacket from the
Friars Club.

KRAMER
Yeah, what time is it?

JERRY
(looks at watch) Ten-thirty.

KRAMER
(pleased) Ah, see. (rubs his hands together) I got the whole night
ahead of me. (looks at Jerry) Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh?
Kramer passes Jerry on his way to the kitchen. Jerry looks downwards at his
attire.

JERRY
(realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It
belongs to the Friars Club.
Kramer has a bowl on the counter and fetches a box of cereal.

KRAMER
Yeah, I like that crest. (he shakes cereal into the bowl) Alright,
here we go.

JERRY
Breakfast?

KRAMER
(pouring cereal) Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.

JERRY
So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?

KRAMER
(enthusiastic) Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have
never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this
idea. (fetches a spoon from the drawer) A restaurant that serves only peanut
butter and jelly. (clicks tongue)

JERRY
What d'you call it?

KRAMER
P B and J's. What d'you think?

JERRY
(deadpan) I think you need more sleep.

KRAMER
(dismissive) Ahh.
Kramer picks up his bowl of cereal and heads for the door.

JERRY
So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
Kramer stops, with the door open, and turns back to Jerry.

KRAMER
I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the
apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.

JERRY
Oh, now you're being ridiculous.

KRAMER
(laughing) He he, yeah.
Kramer begins to exit.

JERRY
(indicates the bowl of cereal) No milk?

KRAMER
Oh, I'll be back.
Kramer leaves and closes the door behind him.
[Elaine's Office, J. Peterman]
It's late at night, and her's is the only light on in the building. Elaine
sits at a computer, typing away at the keyboard. She's surrounded by piles of
paperwork, which she rummages through. She sighs, frustrated at being saddled
with all this work.
[Jerry's Apartment]
It's night, and Jerry lies in bed asleep. Kramer enters the room quietly and
sits on the edge of Jerry's bed.

KRAMER
(quietly) Jerry.
Jerry stirs slightly, but doesn't wake up.

KRAMER
(quietly) Hey Jerry.
Jerry still doesn't wake.

KRAMER
(prodding Jerry) C'mon buddy.
Jerry snaps awake, sitting up and recoiling from the figure on his bed.

JERRY
(startled) Kramer!

KRAMER
You awake?

JERRY
(confused) Wha..? What time is it?

KRAMER
W...It's four.

JERRY
(aghast) Four in the morning?!

KRAMER
Yeah.

JERRY
Well, what's wrong with you?

KRAMER
I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do.
You wanna do something?

JERRY
No. Would you just get out?

KRAMER
You wanna rent a movie?

JERRY
No!

KRAMER
Well, what am I gonna do?
[Elaine's Office, J. Peterman]
Jerry walks over to Elaine, who is working at her computer. She has a
sandwich and a diet soda on her desk.

JERRY
Ready for lunch?

ELAINE
(irked) I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of
stupid Bob Grossberg.
Jerry pulls a face, helps himself to a sandwich and sits down, as Elaine
turns to him.

ELAINE
Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every
time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it
all gets dumped on me.

JERRY
You think he's faking?

ELAINE
I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.
Bob leans around the open door to speak.

BOB
Hey Elaine. (he spots Jerry) Oh, you have a friend.
Jerry waves a finger in greeting.

BOB
(to Elaine) Just wanted to say hi.
Bob makes to depart, but stops as Elaine speaks.

ELAINE
Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give
me a hand with some of the catalogue?

BOB
(cupping his hand behind his ear) I..I'm sorry. What?
Elaine leans toward Bob.

ELAINE
(slower and louder) I'm kind of swamped.
Bob smiles, and holds his tie, as if he's been complimented on it.

BOB
Thank you. I'm having lunch with Mr P. I better get going.
Bob smiles, gives Elaine a wink and leaves.

ELAINE
Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?

JERRY
That was him?

ELAINE
Yes.

JERRY
Somehow I thought he'd be taller.

ELAINE
Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I
got a lotta work to do.

JERRY
(standing) Alright, I'll see you later.
Elaine turns back to her computer. Jerry heads out the door.

ELAINE
Alright.
[Peterman Bathroom]
Bob stands at the urinal. Jerry opens the door and enters the room. He sees
Bob, and wonders about something. Jerry slowly crosses the room until he's
standing about three feet behind Bob.

JERRY
Hey, Bob.
Bob continues to use the urinal, without reaction.

JERRY
Bob.
Still no reaction.

JERRY
Hey, Bobby, over here.
Bob continues his necessary business.

JERRY
Bob. Oh, Bob.
Still nothing.

JERRY
(louder) Bob!
Bob finishes what he has to do, and half-turns to find Jerry behind him.
Jerry feigns innocence, Bob completes his zipping up whilst faced away from
Jerry.

BOB
Hi.
Jerry and Bob give embarrassed acknowledgement smiles.
[Elaine's Office, J. Peterman]
Elaine types away at her computer. Jerry enters.

JERRY
(urgent whisper) Elaine.
Jerry closes the door behind him.

ELAINE
(makes an irked noise)

JERRY
I was just in the bathroom.

ELAINE
(really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really
busy here.

JERRY
No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.

ELAINE
So what?

JERRY
No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
Elaine stands and slaps Jerry on the chest with a bundle of papers.

ELAINE
Get out! What'd you do?

JERRY
Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he
could hear me.

ELAINE
(hopeful) And?

JERRY
Well, he flinched, sort of.

ELAINE
What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?

JERRY
Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up,
I dunno.

ELAINE
So you don't know anything?

JERRY
Actually, no.

ELAINE
(sarcasm) Alright, good job.

JERRY
Right.
Elaine goes back to work. Jerry leaves.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry sits, reading a paper, at the table. There is a knock at the door.

JERRY
Come in.
The door slowly opens wide enough for George to lean into the room. He's
smiling, looks at Jerry and raises his eyebrows quizzically. Jerry smiles
back.

GEORGE
(entering) Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that
something?

JERRY
That was something.

GEORGE
Ah. She's great, isn't she?

JERRY
(positive) Fantastic. Fantastic woman.

GEORGE
I told you.

JERRY
I'm nuts about her.

GEORGE
You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?

JERRY
She could be an 'it'.

GEORGE
(claps hands triumphantly) We might have an 'it'!

JERRY
She's got 'it' written all over her.

GEORGE
She's got everything, right? (counts on his fingers) She's
intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.

JERRY
Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.

GEORGE
Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.

JERRY
Whatever.

GEORGE
(gleeful) Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always
like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?

JERRY
That doesn't sound right.

GEORGE
No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working
on. The Flying Sandos Brother.

JERRY
Flying Sandos. Beautiful.

GEORGE
Great. Seven-thirty, alright?

JERRY
Walk me down to the Friars.
Jerry goes into the bedroom.

GEORGE
Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If
you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...
Jerry reenters looking confused.

JERRY
It's not here.

GEORGE
What?

JERRY
Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
Kramer enters, rubbing his eyes.

KRAMER
Oh, boy.
Jerry is looking around for the jacket, lifting cushions, etc.

JERRY
(to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night.
(frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?

KRAMER
Oh, the one with the crest.

JERRY
Yeah.

JERRY
Oh, well, that's at the cleaners.

JERRY
The cleaners? How did it get there?

KRAMER
Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.

JERRY
(irritated) Great.

KRAMER
(laughing to himself) Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of
garbage.

JERRY
Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!

KRAMER
Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.

JERRY
Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.

GEORGE
Won't be a problem...(mumbles)
Kramer has closed his eyes and fallen asleep while leaning on the counter in
Jerry's kitchen.

JERRY
(to Kramer) Hey.
Kramer does not respond.

JERRY
(louder) Hey!!
Kramer snaps awake with a jerk.

KRAMER
Watch out, boy.
[Bob's Office, J. Peterman]
Bob is working at his desk, with his back to the door. Elaine arrives and
stands in the doorway.

ELAINE
Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?
Bob continues to muse over some of the work in front of him, giving no sign
of knowing Elaine is there.

ELAINE
Bob!
Bob still doesn't react to Elaine. Elaine takes a couple of steps into Bob's
office, and decides to try a different tactic.

ELAINE
(sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
As Elaine speaks, Peterman walks past the open door. Hearing Elaine's voice,
his attention is caught. He stops to listen.

ELAINE
...so much. You're so damn...sexy.
Peterman watches and listens, surprised.

ELAINE
(sexy) Ohh. I'm starting to unbutton.
Peterman decides he should withdraw, and he leaves.

ELAINE
(dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob?
Bob continues to be oblivious to Elaine. Elaine pulls a pensive face and
leaves.
[Theatre]
George, Susan and Hallie sit in a box overlooking the stage (just like the
two guys in the Muppets). There's an empty seat beside Hallie. George is
making small talk.

HALLIE
Well, they perform all over. Europe mostly.

GEORGE
A-ha, huh. (mumbles) tours.

HALLIE
Yeah.
Jerry arrives, wearing the crested jacket.

JERRY
Sorry, sorry I'm late.

GEORGE/SUSAN
Hey!

SUSAN
Jerry.

GEORGE
Isn't that the uh, Friars Club jacket?
Jerry takes the vacant seat.

JERRY
Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.

GEORGE
Sure, sure, sure, sure. (patting Jerry on the shoulders) How about
these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln.

JERRY
Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
Lively music begins and the Flying Sandos Brothers bound onto the stage to
applause from the auditorium. Jerry and his friends all join in.
[Kramer's Apartment]
Kramer sits on his couch with Connie, who is playfully toying with the collar
on his shirt.

KRAMER
So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?

CONNIE
Mmm, no, Cosmo. I like just being here with you.

KRAMER
Oh, it's uh, it's a bold adventure.
Connie leans in and begins to kiss Kramer's neck.

KRAMER
Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.
[Theatre]
The Sandos Brothers are on stage performing a juggling act with glasses,
trays and bottle. It ends with them pouring drinks and toasting the audience.
The audience applaud appreciatively.
The Sandos Brothers launch into the next part of their act. One brother
climbs onto the shoulders of another and is carried to the edge of the stage,
where he climbs from the shoulders into the box containing Jerry, George,
Susan and Hallie. The audience applaud.

SANDOS BROTHER 1
How would you kind people like to lend a hand with our next
trick?

JERRY
(smiling) I don't think so.

SANDOS BROTHER 1
Please, take off your jacket.

JERRY
My jacket?

SANDOS BROTHER 1
Yes, the jacket. (turns to the crowd) What do you say,
ladies and gentlemen?
The rest of the audience cheer and clap.

SANDOS BROTHER 1
(to Jerry) Can't argue with that.

HALLIE
C'mon.

SUSAN
Do it. Come on, Jerry.

GEORGE
Give him the jacket.

JERRY
(giving in) Alright.
Jerry shrugs out of the jacket, to the applause of friends and audience. He
hands it to the Sandos Brother.

SANDOS BROTHER 1
And now, we say the magic word. (gestures with his hand)
Agrabah! And we make it disappear.
As he finishes his speech, he tosses the jacket out of the box and into the
audience. The audience clap, as do George, Susan and Hallie. Jerry peers over
the edge of the box, after the jacket.
[Kramer's Apartment]
Connie lies on the couch, underneath Kramer. She strokes the side of his head
with her fingers.

CONNIE
(passionate) Oh Cosmo. Mm-mmm, Cosmo. Oh Cosmo.
Kramer is oddly unresponsive.

CONNIE
(uncomfortable) Uh, honey, can you move a little, this hurts.
Kramer makes no reply.

CONNIE
(worried) Cosmo?
Connie pushes at Kramer to try and move him.

CONNIE
(panicky) Oh my god. Cosmo, wake up!
Connie heaves harder at Kramer, but he's still not moving or replying.

CONNIE
Cosmo?
Connie lifts Kramer's head and looks at his face, which is completely slack
and expressionless.

CONNIE
(horrified) Oh my god! He's dead! He's dead.
Panicky, Connie tries again to lift Kramer enough to get out, but is unable
to move his inert bulk. She reaches across to the table and grabs the handset
of the phone. Quickly, she dials a number and puts the phone to her ear.

CONNIE
(into phone) Yeah, Tommy, this is Connie. You gotta help me. Some guy
dropped dead on top of me. (listens) I can't call the cops, 'cos Joey might
find out. (listens) I can't. I'm stuck. You gotta help me.
[Theatre, Backstage]
Jerry leads George and the girls up to a door marked 'Dressing Room 3'.

GEORGE
This is very exciting. The inner sanctum.
Jerry knocks on the door. It's opened after a second, by one of the Sandos
Brothers who looks at Jerry, questioningly.

JERRY
Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just
wanted to pick it up.

SANDOS BROTHER 2
Jacket? What jacket?

JERRY
(explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the
audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.

SANDOS BROTHER 2
A..are you sure it was me?

JERRY
Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
Jerry looks past to where another couple of Sandos Brother are still
changing.

SANDOS BROTHER 2
Well, two of them have left already.
The Sandos Brother at the door turns to the other two an rattles off a
question in some foreign language. The other two speak to each other and
reply to the question, also in a foreign tongue, but clearly they don't know
anything.

SANDOS BROTHER 2
(shaking his head apologetically) No.

JERRY
It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.

SANDOS BROTHER 2
Sorry.
The Sandos Brother closes the door, smiling.

HALLIE
Jerry, I'm sure it'll turn up.

JERRY
(cynical) I'm sure it won't.

HALLIE
Don't worry. I'll get the jacket back.

GEORGE
(cheerful) Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back.
(claps hands) So, let's go get some coffee, huh?

JERRY
(downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.

SUSAN
Aww, that's too bad.

GEORGE
Really?

JERRY
Yeah, we'll do it another time.

SUSAN
(bright) George, we'll go.
George doesn't look like the prospect of coffee alone with Susan is something
he relishes.
[Monk's]
George and Susan sit either side of a table, with coffee. There's a definite
lack of sparkling conversation. George forces a smile at Susan. There's a
long pause, broken only by Susan sighing. George finally thinks of something
to say.

GEORGE
I, uh, oh, broke a shoelace today.

SUSAN
Oh, I can get you shoelaces tomorrow.

GEORGE
Okay.

SUSAN
So, what colour?

GEORGE
Brown.
Susan nods her comprehension, as George muses for a moment.

GEORGE
Maybe a black.

SUSAN
Mmm.
The waitress walks by the table with the coffee pot.

WAITRESS
More coffee?

GEORGE
(urgent) No! Check! (quieter) Please.
The waitress pulls the check from her pocket and puts it on the table for
George.
[Hallway Outside Jerry's Apartment]
As Jerry walks up to his door, Kramer's door opens and two guys emerge
carrying a large body-shaped object wrapped in fabric. They carry it away
down the hall.

JERRY
(looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.
Jerry shakes his head at Kramer's antics as he enters his apartment.
[A Lonely Stretch Of Road On The Banks Of The Hudson]
It is night. A large black car squeals to a stop beside the river. The two
guys we just saw leave Kramer's apartment climb out of the car. They open the
trunk and haul out the wrapped object they were carrying. They lug it to the
rail at the edge of the road, and heave it over the edge. It splashes into
the river and begins to sink. The two guys quickly close the trunk of the car
and climb back in.
[Beneath The Hudson River]
The object sinks down into the water. Suddenly, the contents begin to squirm
and jump. The outline of a human body can be seen within the fabric. The top
of the wrappings opens and Kramer emerges. He looks around, wide-eyed, and
would scream with shock, were he not underwater. He kicks his legs and swims
toward the surface.
[The Hudson River]
Kramer breaks the surface with a splutter. He looks round, panicky and
confused.

KRAMER
HEY!! Sh..! Shii! MAMA!!
Kramer looks to one side, where he sees a large ferry bearing down on him. He
turns and begins swimming away from the vessel.

KRAMER
AAH! AAGH!
[Elaine's Office, J. Peterman]
Elaine is working away, when Peterman enters behind her. He's carrying a
couple of bits of card.

PETERMAN
Elaine. I think I've been working you a little too hard, lately.
Peterman sits on the edge of Elaine's desk.

ELAINE
(shrugging it off) Oh.

PETERMAN
So, I have two tickets for you (holds up the bits of card) to the
Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.

ELAINE
(pleased) Ah.

PETERMAN
It is a real hoot.

ELAINE
(delighted) Well, thank you Mr Peterman.

PETERMAN
Ah, the tickets are for tonight. So you and Bob can knock off a
little early, so you both can get ready.
Elaine looks confused. Peterman begins to leave.

ELAINE
Mr Peterman, you...

PETERMAN
(interrupting) There's no need to deny it, Elaine. I heard every
word you said.
Elaine realises what Peterman overheard.

PETERMAN
And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with his handicap.
(staring away) That kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.

ELAINE
(resigned) Of course, Mr Peterman.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is on the phone, as George enters.

JERRY
(into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to
George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a
jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred
dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!
Jerry stalks about as George sits on the couch.

JERRY
(worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take
your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!

GEORGE
It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner
at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.

JERRY
(unenthusiastic) Uhh, I don't think so.

GEORGE
(worried) Why not?

JERRY
(impassive) Ah, I'm a little turned off.

GEORGE
(standing) C'mon, what're you talking about?

JERRY
Ahh, I'm, I'm kinda soured.

GEORGE
You're soured?

JERRY
Yeah, I'm soured.

GEORGE
Don't be soured.

JERRY
I'm sorry. I'm soured.

GEORGE
(animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well.
Where is all this coming from?

JERRY
Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my
jacket.

GEORGE
(animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said
she was gonna get it back.

JERRY
(indifferent) Yeah, we'll see.

GEORGE
(worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason
to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?

JERRY
I'll try and de-sour.

GEORGE
(aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour.
You have to sweeten too!

JERRY
(sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.

GEORGE
I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.

JERRY
I still don't know what that means.

GEORGE
(neither does he) Yeah, well.
The door opens and Kramer enters, fully dressed but soaked to the skin.

KRAMER
God.

JERRY
(astonished) Oh god! What happened to you?!

KRAMER
(animated) She tried to kill me Jerry!

JERRY
Who?

KRAMER
(shouts) Connie!

JERRY
What'd she do?

KRAMER
I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson river
in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the
cops.

JERRY
(bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?

KRAMER
(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to
have me!
Kramer moves to leave, but walks into the door with a loud thud.

KRAMER
(to door) Gah!
Kramer stomps away to his own apartment.
[Friars Club Lobby]
Jerry and George stand where they dealt with the maitre d' on their previous
visit. As they wait, they're people-watching.

JERRY
Hey, there's uncle Milty.

GEORGE
(pleased) Yeah, it is.

JERRY
(pointing) And there's David Steinberg.

GEORGE
The comedian, or the manager?

JERRY
The manager.
George looks unimpressed. Pat Cooper comes walking toward Jerry and George.

JERRY
(to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat.

PAT
Hey, Jerry. What the hell went wrong? What's the matter with you? Are
you a kleptomaniac, or what?

JERRY
I forgot to take it off.

PAT
(dubious) You forgot to take it off? Oh, you go into a department store,
you put a suit on, and you walk right out. What are you some sort of an
idiot?

JERRY
I'm sorry.

PAT
Where's the jacket?

JERRY
Well, one of the gypsies took it.

PAT
(skeptical) Aww, the gypsies took it! Of course, New York has a lot of
gypsies! Oh, on every block there's a gypsy!

GEORGE
(meekly) Well, it's true. I saw it.

PAT
(probing) Excuse me, are you an entertainer? Are you in showbusiness?

GEORGE
No, I uh...

PAT
(interrupting) Then what am I talking to you for? (to Jerry) Jerry,
bring the jacket back tomorrow.

JERRY
Alright.
Pat Cooper walks away from the guys. Jerry motions for George to leave with
him. George looks round and sees something.

GEORGE
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Over at one of the tables, the Sandos Brother who took Jerry's jacket is
entertaining some other guests. He's wearing a familiar crested jacket.

GEORGE
Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show?
He's..he's wearing the jacket.

JERRY
God, you're right.

GEORGE
(motioning Jerry to follow) C'mon.
Jerry and George walk into the Friars Club, but within a couple of strides
they are faced with the maitre d'.

MAITRE D'
Wait a second! Excuse me gentlemen, are you members?

JERRY
Well, I'm a prospective member.

MAITRE D'
Until then, (pointing) that's the way out.

JERRY
But that guy has my jacket.

MAITRE D'
C'mon, let's go.
The maitre d' shepherds Jerry and George out of the door, despite their
continuing protests.

GEORGE
Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is...

MAITRE D'
Come on.

JERRY
Come on.

MAITRE D'
Let's go.

GEORGE
If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
Jerry and George are ejected from the Friars Club.
[Theatre]
Elaine and Bob sit in the same box used by Jerry, George, Susan and Hallie.
Elaine looks distinctly unenthused at the prospect of spending the evening
with Bob. Bob looks delighted to be ensconced with Elaine.

BOB
These seats are fantastic. It was really nice of Mr Peterman to give us
these tickets.

ELAINE
(flat) Yeah, yeah. Was nice.
Bob slips one hand round the back of Elaine's seat and leans slightly toward
her.

BOB
(smiling) Yeah. Got our own little private box here, don't we?
Elaine looks at Bob, wondering what he's talking about. Bob dives across at
Elaine, putting his arms round her and his face on her chest.

ELAINE
(pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.
Elaine succeeds in heaving Bob away from her. She looks at him, angrily.

ELAINE
Get offa me!
Bob stands for a few seconds, with Elaine glaring at him. Then he dives in
for another go. Elaine struggles with him again.

ELAINE
Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats)
Get a hold of yourself!
Bob slowly gets to his feet. Elaine glares at him, and Bob shamefacedly
shuffles away out of the box.
[Theatre, Backstage]
Jerry and George come round a corner in a dingy corridor at the theatre.

JERRY
I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.

GEORGE
I told you, he probably went out the back.
Along the corridor comes the Sandos Brother who took Jerry's jacket. He has a
jacket slung over one shoulder. Jerry and George collide with him.

JERRY
Ouf.
Jerry recognises the guy.

JERRY
Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!

SANDOS BROTHER 1
No, it is not. It is my jacket.
The Sandos Brother backs away from the advancing Jerry and George.

JERRY
(adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.

SANDOS BROTHER 1
No, it is not. This is mine.

JERRY
C'mon I need it.
Jerry grabs hold of the jacket and begins a tug-of-war with it. George joins
in, trying to release the grip of the Sandos Brother. The door to 'Dressing
Room 3' opens and Hallie emerges and watches the struggle.

JERRY
(determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.

GEORGE
Give 'im the jacket already!
Jerry and George succeed in taking the jacket. The Sandos Brother runs away
down the corridor, shouting.

SANDOS BROTHER 1
(yelling) Help! Help! (foreign language) Azobar! Azobar
disay!

GEORGE
What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here!

JERRY
Can you believe it?!
Jerry looks at the jacket they took, and notices something.

JERRY
(examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is
different. It's got a moose on it.

GEORGE
Moose?

JERRY
Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.

HALLIE
No, it's not.
Hallie reaches inside the door of Dressing Room 3 and pulls out a jacket on a
hanger.

HALLIE
This is the jacket.
Jerry and George look mortified. Hallie brings the jacket over to Jerry.

JERRY
Ohh, you got the jacket back.

GEORGE
Ohh, yeahh.

JERRY
(taking the jacket) Thank you.

HALLIE
It got a little dirty, so they wanted to clean it before they gave it
back to you.

JERRY
Oh. (smiling) Oh, that's nice of 'em.

GEORGE
(smiling) That is really nice.

HALLIE
Yeah.

JERRY
Yeah.

HALLIE
Yeah.

JERRY
Yeah.

GEORGE
This is nice.

JERRY
Yeahh.

HALLIE
Yeah.

GEORGE
(forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have
coffee.

HALLIE
(flat) I'll see you at the wedding.
Hallie walks away, leaving George's Gatsby ambitions in tatters.
[Theatre]
Elaine sits alone in the box. Something on the floor catches her eye. It's
Bob's hearing-aid earpiece. Elaine picks it up, and it occurs to her that she
has the opportunity she wanted. She wipes the earpiece on the lapel of her
jacket and carefully slips it over her ear. Elaine cocks her head on one
side, listening to see if it makes a difference.
[Theatre, Backstage]
Jerry and George walk along backstage. Jerry has his jacket, and George is
carrying the Sandos Brother's jacket, looking sullen.

GEORGE
(moody) Great! Now she's sour!

JERRY
Maybe she'll sweeten.

GEORGE
(angry) She won't sweeten, and I'm bitter!
Behind Jerry and George, the Flying Sandos Brothers appear. They look over
toward Jerry and George.

SANDOS BROTHER 1
(pointing) There they are!
The Sandos Brothers set off running after Jerry and George. George hurriedly
puts the jacket down on a table, as he and Jerry begin to hasten.

GEORGE
Here. (panicky) We'll leave it here for you!
Jerry and George run away, as the Sandos Brothers advance.
George is on the lead as he and Jerry reach a door marked 'Emergency Exit.
Alarm will sound'. George pushes the door open and he and Jerry dart through.
As they do, a loud alarm bell begins to ring.
[Theatre]
Elaine is sitting wearing the earpiece when the alarm sounds. Obviously, the
earpiece works, as Elaine spasms in pain at the ringing. She clutches her
hands to her ears and jerks off her seat, falling out of sight onto the floor
of the box.
[Hallway, Apartment Building]
Kramer stands outside the door to an apartment, flanked by two other guys.
One of the guys knocks at the door. After a few seconds, it is opened by
Connie.

KRAMER
(pointing) That's her, officer.

CONNIE
(shocked) Kramer! Oh my god, I thought you were...

KRAMER
(animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!
The detective shows his shield to Connie.

DETECTIVE
You're under arrest for the attempted murder of Cosmo Kramer.

CONNIE
(defensive) I didn't do anything.

KRAMER
(sarcastic) Oh, yeah! Yeah!

DETECTIVE
Get your coat, we gotta take you in.

CONNIE
Can I call my lawyer?

DETECTIVE
Okay, go ahead.
Connie goes back into her apartment.
[Connie's Apartment/Lawyer's Office]

CONNIE
(on phone) You gotta meet me at the police station. They're arresting
me for attempted murder.
On the phone in his office is Jackie Chiles.

JACKIE
Attempted murder? Of whom?

CONNIE
This guy, Kramer.

JACKIE
Oh. (hesitantly) Cosmo Kramer?

CONNIE
(surprised) Yeah, that's right.

JACKIE
(adamant) I don't want nothing to do with it.
Jackie puts down his phone and looks glad to have escaped.
End.

OPENING MONOLOGUE
I really like the wig historically. I guess the revolutionary war, the last war fought in wig,
and it seems that it must have been hard. You know they're going in to battle,they think
Well do I have my bullets? Do I have my bobby pins.. and you got to make sure you have
everything... lot more to worry about "What if I get killed.? Is my wig on straight?
I don't know when the whole wig thing came in to style for men... but I know when it went out.!
When the mirror was invented. No guy is looking in the mirror powdering a patch of horsehair
on his head going .."All right! lets go rap (?) to the ladies..
At the Andover shop

JERRY
"I'm looking for a crested blazer"

CRAIG
"A crested blazer.."

JERRY
"I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me."

CRAIG 
(turning around):" Yes .I Think we may have something."
(picks up a blazer) The Joseph Aboud crested blazer is the finest....
That's hand ticking around the crest and these are the world famous
Corriso buttons made from the finest Andulo corn."

JERRY
(softly) "Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers."

CRAIG
"It looks fabulous on you... shall I wrap it up?"

JERRY
"You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone
and see what they think."

CRAIG
(doubtful)" A Hum!"

JERRY
"Really I'll be back."

CRAIG
"Yeah!"
Cuts to Jerry's apartment.
George is pacing back and forth with the phone and Elaine and Jerry are talking.
 

JERRY
"So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me
so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought....
And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me."

ELAINE
"Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!"

JERRY
"Yeah..... He caught me"
"So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend
to look at the coat."

ELAINE
"That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?"

JERRY
"Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't."

ELAINE
"But you were!!"

JERRY
"But if you go back with me , then I'm not."

GEORGE
still on the phone) "All right fine.... Whatever"
Kramer walks in.

JERRY
(to George) " Problems with the house guest?"

ELAINE
"What house guest?"

GEORGE
"This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I
wrong or is that excessive?"

KRAMER
"Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half."

ELAINE
"Who is he?"

GEORGE
"He's a wig master"

ELAINE
"What is a wig master?"

GEORGE
"He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.
He's the guy in charge of the wigs."

JERRY
"Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice."

KRAMER
"About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek.."

GEORGE
(leaving) "Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot."

KRAMER
"Euh what...What lot is that?"

GEORGE
"Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month."

KRAMER
"Seventy -five bucks a month!"

GEORGE
" Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on.."

KRAMER
" Oh I'm down."
Cuts to the Andover shop

JERRY
(proud of himself) "Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did."
"Surprised?."

CRAIG
"No I believed you."

JERRY
"Yeah.... well Elaine."

ELAINE
(looking up to the salesman)

CRAIG
"Oh!... hello I'm Craig."

ELAINE
".....Hi."

CRAIG
"well (picks up the blazer again) here it is."

ELAINE
"Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest."

CRAIG
"You know your coats?"

ELAINE
"Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman."

CRAIG
"I love J. Peterman."

ELAINE
(giggling) "Ohhh!!."

CRAIG
"I especially enjoy the catalogue, those fanciful narratives really take me away.."

ELAINE
"Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those."

CRAIG
"No!!!"

ELAINE
"Yeeeahh!!!"

JERRY
(impatiently cutting in) " Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest
here."
Elaine "Well I love it... "

JERRY
"You what??"

ELAINE
"I think it's great. I think you should get it."

CRAIG
"Well .... Will it be check or credit card?"

JERRY
(giving up) "Check."

CRAIG
"I'll need you to write down your phone number on the check for me. (turning to Elaine)
"Perhaps you could do the same."

ELAINE
(laughs and giggles like a schoolgirl)
Cuts to a street where Jerry & Elaine are walking

JERRY
"You weren't supposed to say that."

ELAINE
"But I really did like it"

JERRY
"That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice."

ELAINE
"uhn... Sorry!"

JERRY
"And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?"

ELAINE
"What is the big deal!!"

JERRY
"...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're
there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!"

ELAINE
"He dared...."
Cuts to George's apartment as he comes in.

ETHAN
(sitting in the couch and combing his wigs)"Hi George.. How was your day?"

GEORGE
"Good....good day (not too convincing) You?"

ETHAN
"I am getting so much work done..... See?"

GEORGE
"Very nice"

SUSAN
(walks in) "Hi sweety How was your day?

ETHAN
"I already ask him that. He said Good...Good day...."
George scratches his head and the scene cuts to Jerry and Kramer's hallway

KRAMER
(frantically pulling at his doorknob) "Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out.
I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring.
So you got my spare?"

JERRY 
"No I gave it back to you"

KRAMER
"y'did.........phfwelll. Look.. hum..... Can you take me over there?"

JERRY
"Oh Come on!!"

KRAMER
"Oh Come on Jerry, It's all the way over to twelfth avenue.."

JERRY
 "I didn,t tell you to park in that lot .. Now someone's gonna have
to drive you every time you need your car.? Take the bus!"

KRAMER
"I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!"

JERRY
"Forget it."

KRAMER
"Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up."

JERRY
"He wont take ya.."
Kramer picks up the phone, calls George
Phone rings at Georges and he's sitting between Susan and the wig master.

GEORGE
(grabs the phone quick) "Got it, Got it,...Hello?"

KRAMER
"Listen, Can you take me over to the Jiffy Park?"

GEORGE
"Yeah,yeah!! I'll pick you up right now.....All right All right....Hey! gotta go."
Cuts to Georges car. Kramer changes the stations on the radio

GEORGE
"So the Wig master.......the Wig master said you could stop by the theater tonight..
and he'll show you around."

GEORGE
"WOULD YOU PICK A STATION!!!!!"

KRAMER
"I like 'em all"(still fiddles with the radio)

GEORGE
"Aw great. Now the volume knob fell off

KRAMER
(seems to pickup something on the floor) "....'s'this?"

KRAMER
"Gawd!!!"

KRAMER
"That's a....ca.....ca..........Condom!!"
They both shriek and the scene cuts to Monks

ELAINE
"How do you like working there at the .... hum...Andover shop?"

CRAIG 
"Hmmm

ELAINE
"except for Jerry!"(laughs)

CRAIG

CRAIG
"Well...hum.....we'll just have to do something about that. Won't we."

ELAINE
"Ah! Ah!ah!
Jerry peeks into Monks window then comes in as Craig is leaving.

JERRY
"Hey! Greg"

CRAIG
"It's Craig"

JERRY
"Ah! right...nice. Lunch with Elaine?

CRAIG
"Yes lovely."
Jerry "You know 'm just curious, How did you know she wasn't my girlfriend?"

JERRY
"Because you know we used to go out."

CRAIG
"Oh ! you did"

JERRY
"Oh Yeah we went way out and wild."

ELAINE
"Hey Jerr..."

JERRY
"Hi Elaine."
In comes a lady selling roses

LADY
"Would you like to buy a rose for your wife? ( to Craig)"
Craig and Elaine both laugh

JERRY
"How do you know she's not my wife?

GEORGE
"That doesn't explain the lipstick on the dashboard?"

ATTENDANT
"Here take a few shirts...."
A man walks over the attendant and whispers in to his ears.

ATTENDANT
"I'm terribly sorry Mr Kramer but we can't get your car now, the keys seems
to have been misplaced."

KRAMER
"Wait a minute I need those keys. I wont be able to get into my apartment.

ATTENDANT
"Aaye Mr Kramer....You like Cadillacs?"

KRAMER
"...Yeah I like Cadillacs (cautiously) Why ? What you got on your mind?"

Hooker picks up the money as George looks embarrassed.
Scene cuts to George's apartment.

SUSAN
"..So you're telling me the truth?"

GEORGE
"Of Course I'm telling the truth."

SUSAN
"Because I have to be able to trust you... If I can't trust you then there's no way that
this can work."

GEORGE
"Really!"

SUSAN
"Yeah."

GEORGE 
"Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's
any doubt in your mind ....and.. and,, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know
even a tiny doubt, a DOT of a doubt.. and....."

SUSAN
"There's no doubt."

Cuts to Jerry's apartment. Jerry and Kramer are watching tv.

JERRY
"You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me.

KRAMER
"Heeeeeummmrph.... I'm gonna turn in"

JERRY
"I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!"

KRAMER
"Well you can go to your room and read."

JERRY
"Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here.
You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me."

KRAMER
"But I'm tired.."

JERRY
"Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's."

KRAMER
"Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin...I know I'm gonna get cold.
I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep...."

JERRY
"Well that's all I got."

KRAMER
"Can I sleep with you?"

JERRY
"Huh?"

KRAMER
"Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt."

JERRY
"Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me."

KRAMER
"Why?"

JERRY
"Why?"

KRAMER
"Yeah!"

"You want it?"

KRAMER
"Yeaaahmm...."

ELAINE
"You can have ,I don't need it anymore."

KRAMER
"Ooh Mama...( walks away)

ELAINE
"Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig."

JERRY
"Yeah Why?"

ELAINE
"Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry."

JERRY
"So ,Who is he?"

ELAINE
"Some friend of his from England."

JERRY
"Don't you see?...........It's all a big scam."

ELAINE
"You're nuts!"

KRAMER
"How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?"

ELAINE 
"What d'you mean?"

KRAMER
"What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the
discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when
you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato.

ELAINE
"Aawwh Please....."

KRAMER
"Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free
exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you
would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed."
Scene cuts to Jerry's bed. Lights are out. Kramer opens the light and starts to read.

KRAMER
(softly)"hmmm....patio furniture's on sale."
Cuts to the Jiffy Park the next morning.

GEORGE
"Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please."

ATTENDANT
"Whats the problem"

GEORGE
"You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters."

ATTENDANT
"Haaan! That is all hearsay."

GEORGE
"Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please"

ATTENDANT
"Can't do it'

GEORGE
"Whadday'mean.?"

ATTENDANT
"If you read the agreement you signed the deposit is not refundable."

GEORGE
"Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse?
'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either.."

ATTENDANT
"What can I tell you buddy. Take it up with Consumer Affairs."

GEORGE
 "All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here."

ATTENDANT
"Well that's going to be a problem"

GEORGE
"Why?"

ATTENDANT
"It's all the way in the back. Can't get it out for a couple of days."

GEORGE
"What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!!"

ATTENDANT
"We ask that you please bear with us."

GEORGE
"Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET
THEIR CARS!!!"

ATTENDANT
"Ideally.."
Scene cuts to the Andover shop.

JERRY
"Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket."

TELLER
"Certainly. May I ask why?"

JERRY
"........For spite..."

TELLER
"Spite?"

JERRY
"That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me."

TELLER
"I don't think you can return an item for spite."

JERRY
"What do you mean?"

TELLER
"Well if there was some problem with the garment. If it were unsatisfactory in some way,then
we could do it for you, but I'm afraid spite doesn't fit into any of our conditions for a refund"

JERRY
"That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is."

TELLER
"Let me speak with the manager...excuse me .............Bob!"
(walks over to the manager and whispers)
Teller "........spite....."(Manager walks over)

BOB
"What seems to be the problem?"

JERRY 
"Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she
won't take it back."

BOB
"That's true. You can't return an item based purely on spite."

JERRY
 "Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it"

BOB
"Well you already said spite so......"

JERRY
"But I changed my mind.."

BOB
"No...you said spite...Too late."
Cuts to a terrace where Kramer is sitting with Ethan and a woman.

Elaine "Oh Thanks, thank you very much."

ETHAN

ELAINE
"Hummm.... so you've no idea when.. they'll arrive."

CRAIG
(yawns) ...Nno....I really don't......
Back to the terrace with Jerry and Ethan

ETHAN
"How can she go with a guy like that , he's a mess... I just don't see them together at all"

Back to Elaine's phone rings.

ELAINE
"Hello."

BOB
 "Hi this is Bob from the Andover Shop. I'm trying to reach Craig Stewart. He left this
number."

ELAINE
"Uhmmm huh! Is it important.?

BOB
"Well....."

ELAINE
"Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from
Milan?."

BOB
"Nicole Millers, We're not expecting any Nicole Millers, in fact we have too many as it is."
Elaine "Well do you have any in a... size four.?"

BOB
"Yes several.. Just tell him he doesn't have to be in tomorrow before Eleven."

ELAINE
(sarcastically) Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message."
Elaine then looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks "They make wigs out of human hair....And pay
plenty for them."
she then picks up a pair of scissors..
Scene cuts to a woman in a white coat and hat leaving a store. Her hat gets caught in a gust of wind.
and starts rolling down the street. Kramer picks up the hat with the walking stick and puts it on.
He struts down the street with the Dreamcoat/hat/stick looking very much like a stereotype pimp.
He goes to the Jiffy Park to pick up the Cadillac"

KRAMER
(looks inside the car and gasps) Ohhh Sweet Maria. Hey! lets go.
Out comes the hooker with a client.

KRAMER
"Hey What are you doing in my car? Hey!Hey!Hey! Where you going."

HOOKER
"Hey. You just cost me some money Mr.(starts hitting Kramer)

KRAMER
"Cool it lady ( they struggle and we here a siren)

POLICE
"Policer officer. Freeze right there."
As the credits roll we hear an officer telling Kramer who is to get his picture taken.

POLICE
"OK Big Daddy. Take the hat off...... awright turn to your right...(Kramer hesitates)
I SAID TURN PIMP."

KRAMER
(cries) I'M NOT A PIMP.!!!.
End.
George in a meeting at Yankee Stadium

GEORGE 
I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls , here at the stadium ,
don't offer much by way of privacy . But I was thinking if we extend the doors
all the way to the floors ......

MR. . STEINBRENNER 
All the way to the floor ! What are you crazy ! You'd
suffocate in there . Your lucky you have any doors at all . You know when I
was in the army ...... Hey Costanza . What's that your eating over there ? It
looks pretty tasty .

ELAINE 
He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars .

JERRY 
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars !?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader .
I don't think so .

ELAINE 
That's what I said .

JERRY 
So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner ?

George and Mr. Steinbrenner at Yankee Stadium

MR. STEINBRENNER 
I am loving this calzone . The pita pocket prevents it from
dripping . The pita pocket . (phone rings)What is it Watson ? A lost and found
. No . I don't think we need that . If people keel over because they lost
something that's there tough luck . You got a drip on your mouth by the way .

GEORGE 
You know a lost and found could be a good idea .

MR. STEINBRENNER 
Hold on Watson . You like lost and found George ?

GEORGE

MR. STEINBRENNER 
All right lost and found . But these got to be a time limit
. We're not running a pawn shop here .

JERRY 
We'll see .

TODD 
Hey Jerry . Do you like cigars ?

JERRY

Jerry and George at the coffee shop

GEORGE 
There putting in a lost and found because of me . There's a time
limit but still .

JERRY 
There really building a Utopian society up there huh .And you
tribute all this to the calzone .

GEORGE 
Yeah . I am like a drug dealer . I got the guy hooked . I am having
lunch at his desk everyday this week . He doesn't make a move without me .
It's very exciting .

JERRY 
With you two guys at the helm . The last piece of the puzzle is in
place.

GEORGE 
So let me ask you a question about the tip jar . I had a little
thing with the calzone guy this week . I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and
just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way . And then when I am
leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing . I mean if they don't
notice it what's the point .

JERRY 
So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind .

GEORGE 
Not bills .

JERRY 
So George . Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants .
We are at the movies last night . It's sold out . Nikki goes and talks to the
manager . Right in .

GEORGE 
Beautiful women . You know they could get away with murder . You
never she any of them lift anything over three pounds . They get whatever they
want whenever they want it . You can't stop them .

JERRY 
She's like a beautiful Godzilla .

GEORGE 
Without thousands of fleeing Japanese .
Jerry and Kramer at his apartment

KRAMER 
Hey buddy .

JERRY 
What the hell is all this ?

KRAMER 
I am looking for quarters for the dryer .

Huh . Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too .

JERRY 
Oh !! Let me ask you a question . Was the movie part of the bet ?
Kramer leaves

ELAINE 
No . We were both in the mood for one .

JERRY 
You know Elaine , It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of
close fiends ....

ELAINE 
Oh is that so .

JERRY 
Absolutely . But I feel I must inform you that what happened last
night was more than a simple bet .

ELAINE 
What are you talking about ?

JERRY 
Come on . Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars . He made a bet he knew he was
going to lose just to take you to dinner

ELAINE 
If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.

JERRY 
Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected . He has
found a dating loop hole .

ELAINE 
I don't buy it.
Kramer walks in with more change

JERRY 
So what happened after the movie ?

ELAINE 
Nothing . He walked me home .

JERRY 
No , no .

ELAINE 
No , no .

JERRY 
So how did you leave it with him ?

GEORGE 
How about Chinese ?

MR. STEINBRENNER 
Uhhhhh . No . Too many containers . Big mess , big mess .
Too sloppy .I want to stick with the calzones from Pisano's . That's the
ticket .

GEORGE 
I just thought it would be nice . A little variety .

MR. STEINBRENNER 
No , no , no . George let me tell you something . When I
find something I like I stick with it . From 1973 to 1982 I ate the exact same
lunch everyday . Turkey chili in a bowl made out of bread . Bread bowl George
. First you eat the chili then you eat the bowl . There's nothing more
satisfying than looking down after lunch and seeing nothing but a table .
Todd walking Elaine to her apartment

ELAINE 
Thanks for the dinner .

TODD 
Well I had to give these cigars and we were both hungry .

ELAINE

Kramer leaves

GEORGE 
Well this is bad . I am really in a bad situation now .

JERRY

GEORGE 
What's he going to do ? That's exactly the point . Nobody knows what
this guy is capable of ! He fires people like it is a bodily function .

JERRY 
Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for
you ?

GEORGE 
Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him . You know
how these interoffice politics work .

No . I never had a job .

George at Newman's apartment

NEWMAN 
You certainly are in a bind .

GEORGE 
Yeah . And since you go buy there everyday . I was hoping that we
could help each other out .

NEWMAN 
Oh well . Let me perfectly blunt . I don't care for you Costanza .
You hang out at the west side of the building with Seinfeld all day and just

NEWMAN 
And a slice of pepperoni pizza and a large soda and three times a
week I will require a canolie .

GEORGE 
That's a little steep don't you think ?

NEWMAN 
You know I hear Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic . I would hate
to see him when he's hungry .

GEORGE 
All right , all right .

NEWMAN 
Do we have a deal ?

GEORGE 
But I have to have them by one o'clock . He's very regiment about his
meals .

NEWMAN

End.
[Nightclub]
Jerry's standup monologue.

JERRY
I love it when you get your car back from the car place, and
it's got that paper mat on the floor. Like they're so obsessed with cleanliness,
they don't even want their shoes to touch the carpet. Meanwhile, the
mechanic comes out; he looks like Al Jolson. He's covered in goo, from head to toe.
You can't even see him. Although, I prefer that to when they have the lab coat,
The clipboard and the nice glasses. Now you know you're getting screwed.
(as concerned car owner) 'Can I see it?' (as doctor-like mechanic) 'You
better not. It's idling quietly right now. I think it should stay overnight. We
wanna keep an eye on it, and we wanna keep the bill running up.'
 
[Yankee Stadium]
Mr Wilhelm is hurrying along a corridor, with George trailing in his
wake. As Wilhelm speaks, George is making notes onto a pad and looking
flustered.

WILHELM
And you can tell the players that I reimburse the trainer for
The cigarettes and the dive checks.

GEORGE
Sorry, the players will be reimbursed?

WILHELM
The trainer, George. Tell the players I'll reimburse the
trainer. What's the matter with you? This is the third time I've had to repeat
myself.

GEORGE
Sorry, Mr Wilhelm.

WILHELM
Look, sorry doesn't cut it. We're running a ball club here
George. You've got to pay attention.

GEORGE
I know, sir. It won't happen again.

WILHELM
Lemme see, I uh, I had an assignment for you... uh.
Wilhelm wanders across the corridor, thinking to himself, he opens the
door to the men's room and strolls through.

WILHELM
Lemme think here.
George starts to follow Wilhelm into the men's room, but thinks better
of it. He wonders briefly what to do, then leans against the wall by the door, to
await Wilhelm's return.
 
[Elaine's Office]
Elaine sits behind her desk working at her computer. Mr Peterman
enters. He's carrying an auction house catalogue.

PETERMAN
Elaine.

ELAINE
Hi, Mr Peterman.

PETERMAN
You know what a huge fan I am of John F Kennedy.

ELAINE
I do.

PETERMAN
It was the Peace Corps that gave me my start in this
business. (nostalgic) Clothing the naked natives of Bantu Besh.

ELAINE
The pygmy pullover.

PETERMAN
Sotheby's is having an auction of JFK's memorabilia. One item
in particular has caught my eye. The presidential golf clubs. To me, they
capture that indefinable romance that was Camelot.

ELAINE
Whatever.

PETERMAN
But, unfortunately I will be out of town with my lady-friend
And therefore unable to bid on the lot. I was hoping maybe you would go in
my stead.

ELAINE
Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much
d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing
to go?

PETERMAN
I would see no trouble in spending up to, say, ten thousand
dollars. Have my secretary give you a signed cheque.
He drops the catalogue on the surprised Elaine's desk and exits.

ELAINE
Wow.
 
[Yankee Stadium]
George still waits outside the men's room. He's been waiting a while.
He looks at his watch and decides to go in. As he enters, he finds Wilhelm
emerging from a stall, and still talking.

WILHELM
...when you're done George, and bring it directly to me. Mr
Steinbrenner is very interested in this.
Wilhelm washes his hands, while George looks panicky and opts to bluff
it out.

GEORGE
Yes, sir.

WILHELM
(drying his hands and heading for the door) Yes, George. I
want you to make this project a top priority.

GEORGE
I will, sir. Top priority.

WILHELM
(exiting) Top priority.

GEORGE
Top priority.
George throws up his arms in despair.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry and George stand. George is explaining what happened.

GEORGE
So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.

JERRY
He pulled an LBJ on you.

GEORGE
LBJ?

JERRY
Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.

GEORGE
No kidding?

JERRY
Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He
planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.

GEORGE
Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even
know what my assignment is.

JERRY
Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.

GEORGE
I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention.
Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.

JERRY
You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him
you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.

GEORGE
Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work.
The door opens and Kramer enters, followed by Newman. Kramer is
carrying a large can of some foodstuff, from which he is eating the odd morsel. Newman
has a pack of soda (mellow yellow?), and is swigging from one of the bottles.

KRAMER
Hey buddy.

JERRY
Hey.

GEORGE
Hey.

JERRY
Can I have my keys...

KRAMER
(tossing car keys to Jerry) Yeah.

JERRY
(catching keys) ...back, please?

KRAMER
You shoulda come, Jerry.

NEWMAN
We made quite a haul.

GEORGE
Where'd you go?

KRAMER
Price club.

GEORGE
Why didn't you take your car?

KRAMER
Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.
Newman finishes his soda and drops the bottle in Jerry's bin.

KRAMER
What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't
throw that away.

NEWMAN
Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling
thing.

KRAMER
You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read
the label here. (reads from bottle) Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New
York. Refund, (brings bottle up close to Newman's eyes) vrrup, five cents.

NEWMAN
(taking bottle) Refund?

KRAMER
Yes.

JERRY
Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?

NEWMAN
I don't know, they're deranged.
Kramer and Newman sit on Jerry's couch. Kramer has TV Guide, Newman
Still reading the bottle.

GEORGE
Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?

JERRY
No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this
Kennedy auction.

GEORGE
Awright, I'll see you later.
George leaves. Jerry exits to the bedroom.

NEWMAN
(peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'?

KRAMER
That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.

NEWMAN
Ten cents!?

KRAMER
Yeah.

NEWMAN
Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents
there. You could round up bottles here and run 'em out to Michigan for the
difference.

KRAMER
No, it doesn't work.

NEWMAN
What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles
together...

KRAMER
Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on
gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.

JERRY
(re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit
bottle scam again, are you?

KRAMER
No, no, I'm off that.

NEWMAN
You tried it?

KRAMER
Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove
me crazy.

JERRY
(leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?

NEWMAN/KRAMER
(simultaneous) No problem. You bet.
Jerry exits, shaking his head.
 
[Sotheby's]
An auction room, with several rows of seating facing a platform with a
lectern for the auctioneer. Many people sit or stand around, with catalogues
And numbered paddles for making bids. Jerry and Elaine enter.

JERRY
Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know
Those two idiots did something to it.

ELAINE
No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my
God, look who's here.

JERRY
Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.
Sue Ellen notices them, and comes over.

SUE ELLEN
Well. Hello Elaine. Jerry.

ELAINE
Hi Sue Ellen.

JERRY
Hi Sue Ellen.

SUE ELLEN
I'm surprised to see you here. Come to catch a glimpse of
high society?

ELAINE
(faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to
bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.

JERRY
I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.

SUE ELLEN
Well, I hope you find something that fits your budget.
Sue Ellen walks away to her seat. Elaine and Jerry make their way to
their seats,

ELAINE
(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Kramer and Newman are still on Jerry's couch. Kramer is watching TV,
While Newman has been working something out on a pad.

NEWMAN
I don't understand. You fill an eighteen-wheeler?

KRAMER
No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got
permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.

NEWMAN
I wanna learn. I want to know why.
 
[Sotheby's]
A bag of golf clubs is brought onto the platform.

ELAINE
(loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome.
Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.

AUCTIONEER
Lot number seven forty-five. We have a full set of golf
clubs, that were owned by President John F Kennedy, as seen in the famous
photograph of the president chipping at Burning Tree on the morning of the Bay of Pigs
invasion. The set in perfect condition, and we will start the bidding at four
thousand dollars. Four thousand dollars? Do I have four thousand dollars?
A man behind Elaine raises his paddle to bid.

AUCTIONEER
I have four thousand dollars. Do I have five? (another
person bids) Five thousand dollars. I have five thousand dollars. Do I have six? Six
thousand dollars for this set of beautiful clubs. (another bid) Six. I have six
thousand dollars. Can I have sixty-five hundred?
Elaine raises her paddle to bid.

AUCTIONEER
Sixty-five hundred to the dark-haired person on the right.
We are at sixty-five hundred, do I hear sixty-six hundred?
Sue-Ellen looks thoughtful.

AUCTIONEER
The president's own golf clubs. Leisure life at Camelot.
Sixty-five hundred going once...
Jerry and Elaine think they've got them.

SUE ELLEN
Eight thousand.

AUCTIONEER
Eight thousand. We have eight thousand. The bid is now
eight thousand dollars.

ELAINE
(to Jerry) What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding
now? (to Auctioneer) Eighty-five hundred!

AUCTIONEER
We have eighty-five...

SUE ELLEN
Nine thousand.

AUCTIONEER
Nine thousand dollars.

JERRY
Think she wants those clubs.

AUCTIONEER
Do I hear ninety-five? Ninety-five hundred...

ELAINE
Ninety-five hundred.

SUE ELLEN
Ten thousand.

AUCTIONEER
Ten thousand, to the shapely woman on the left. Ten
thousand going once...

JERRY
Well, that's your ceiling.

AUCTIONEER
Ten thousand going twice...
Sue Ellen looks over at Elaine, with a smirk.

ELAINE
(determined) Eleven thousand!

SUE ELLEN
Twelve thousand.

ELAINE
(angrier) Thirteen thousand!

SUE ELLEN
Fourteen thousand.

ELAINE
(vicious) Fifteen thousand!!
Jerry buries his face in his hands.
 
[Jerry's Car]
Jerry is driving Elaine home. In the back seat, the golf clubs can be
seen. There is a persistent clunking sound coming from the car.

ELAINE
Peterman is gonna kill me.

JERRY
I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.

ELAINE
Why didn't you stop me?

JERRY
Do you hear this clunking?

ELAINE
(listening) A little.
 
[Jerry's Car, later]
The Saab halts outside Elaine's apartment building.

ELAINE
Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from
You later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.

JERRY
Okay.

ELAINE
Alrighty, bye.

JERRY
Bye.
Elaine leaves the car and walks away. Jerry restarts the car, when he
Notices steam and smoke emerging from under the hood.

JERRY
What's going on here?
Jerry gets out of the car and runs to raise the hood.

JERRY
Oh God!
Jerry opens the hood of his car. As the smoke and steam clears, it
becomes clear there are a variety of comestibles arranged on and around the engine
compartment.

JERRY
(angry) Oh, you idiots!
 
[Jerry's Apartment]
Kramer and Newman still occupy the couch.

NEWMAN
So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and
mean?

KRAMER
Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he
is.

JERRY
Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?

KRAMER
(to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.

NEWMAN
(to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is.

JERRY
And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said
I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you
thinking?

KRAMER
We ran outta space.

JERRY
Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.

KRAMER
Ah, Tony, he's good.

JERRY
Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He
makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get
it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.

KRAMER
(offering the artichoke can) 'Choke?'

JERRY
No, thank you.
 
[Auto Shop]
Jerry and Tony stand beside the Saab. Jerry looks worried and Tony is
Looking like he's in love with the car. He runs his hands over the roof and
along the lines of the bodywork. Tony is a little intense.

TONY
(lovingly) Oh, yeah. I remember this car. Beautiful car.

JERRY
Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I
thought it might be time for a check up...
Tony isn't hearing Jerry. He climbs into the driver's seat and begins
Ferreting about.

JERRY
There's really nothing wrong on the inside.

TONY
Well, the shift knob is loose. You know about that?

JERRY
No, I hadn't noticed.

TONY
(accusingly) Have you been picking at it?

JERRY
Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and
tear.

TONY
(disapprovingly) Wear and tear. I see.

JERRY
The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.

TONY
You been rotating the tires?

JERRY
Try to.

TONY
(sharp) You don't try to. You do it! Fifty-one percent of all
turns are right turns. You know that? 'Try to.'
 
[Elaine's Office]

PETERMAN
Twenty thousand dollars!?! Elaine, that's twice the amount I
authorised you to spend.

ELAINE
I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just
couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know,
certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in
public without any regard...

PETERMAN
Well, where are they?

ELAINE
(ingratiatingly) They should be here today.
 
[George's Office]
George stands, silently rehearsing his follow-up question. Wilhelm
walks by the window, down the corridor. George takes the plunge.

GEORGE
Uh, Mr Wilhelm.

WILHELM
(entering the office) Yes George.

GEORGE
Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh,
My assignment.

WILHELM
Yes, well I trust things are moving smoothly. Mr
Steinbrenner's counting on you, you know.

GEORGE
Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna
attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what
do you think would be the very best way to get started?

WILHELM
(confusion) Get started? I don't understand, George.

GEORGE
Well, I was wondering...

WILHELM
You mean you haven't been to payroll?

GEORGE
Payroll? No, no, I haven't done that.

WILHELM
Well, what's the problem? Now come on George. I told the big
man you were moving on this. Now, don't let him down!
Wilhelm leaves.

GEORGE
Payroll!!
George grabs his jacket, races to the door, checks Wilhelm has gone,
and darts off down the corridor.
 

[YANKEE STADIUM
Payroll Office]
A meek looking clerk sits behind a counter. George enters.

GEORGE
Hello there. I'm George Costanza.

CLERK
Yes?

GEORGE
Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction)
I'm uh, working on the project.

CLERK
What project?

GEORGE
Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.

CLERK
You're gonna have to fill me in.

GEORGE
You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little
while. (moving to come round the counter) I'll just browse around.

CLERK
(blocking George) Hey, wait, hey. Excuse me, uh, you can't come
Back here.

GEORGE
Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have
a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.

CLERK
Well, maybe I will.

GEORGE
(spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take
it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing
here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me.

CLERK
(on phone) Mr Wilhelm, uh, this is Lafarge in payroll. Uh,
there's a Costanza here, says he's working on some project?
George is leaning across the counter, trying to hear Wilhelm's side of
the converstion.

CLERK
(on phone) Oh. (he swaps the phone to his other ear) Oh, I see.
(listens) Interesting. (listens) Well, that's quite a project. Alright, thank
you.
The clerk puts down the phone. George looks expectant.

CLERK
(apologetically) Ah, I'm sorry uh, that I doubted you. Whatever
you need, just uh, make yourself at home.

GEORGE
So he explained it all to you?

CLERK
Yes, he explained it all very clearly.

GEORGE
What'd he tell you?

CLERK
(upset) Look! You were right, I was wrong! You don't have to
humiliate me about it, alright!
 
[Newman's Apartment}
Newman sits on his couch. He's using an old mechanical adding machine
and a pad to work on permutations for the 'Michigan deposit bottle scam'. There
are spools of used paper from the adding machine all over the table and maps of
the northeastern states of the US pinned up on the wall. He taps out a
series of number, pulls the handle and reads the result, then looks at what he's
written on his pad.

NEWMAN
Damn!
Frustrated, he sits back. He notices a framed photograph of his mother.
A thought occurs.

NEWMAN (V.O.)
Oh, Mother's Day. (inspiration strikes) Wait a second.
Mother's Day?!
He starts typing figures into the adding machine rapidly. He mouths
numbers to himself, shrugging as he makes estimates. When he finishes he tears the
paper strip from the machine, compares it to figures on his pad.

NEWMAN
(triumphant) Yessss!
In celebration he swigs from a bottle of soda.

NEWMAN
Ahaha!
 
[Hallway]
Newman hurries up to Kramer's door and hammers on it with his fist. He
waits a few seconds, then impatiently hammers agin.

NEWMAN
Come on Kramer!
The door opens to reveal Kramer midway through a shave, holding a
razor, with
foam on his face.

KRAMER
Wha...?

NEWMAN
It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!

KRAMER
Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.

NEWMAN
No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office
sends one truckload of mail to the second domestic regional sorting facility in
Sagenaw, Michigan.

KRAMER
(interested) Uh-huh.

NEWMAN
But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On
alentine's Day, we send two trucks. On Christmas, four, packed to the brim. And tomorrow,
if history is any guide, will see some spillover into a fifth truck.

KRAMER
(realisation) Mother's Day.

NEWMAN
The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the
truck.

KRAMER
A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost
structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent.

NEWMAN
(excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!

KRAMER
Newman, you magnificent bastard, you did it!

NEWMAN
(triumph) Let the collecting begin!
They embrace joyfully.
 
[Montage of scenes]
A woman puts a soda can on top of a mail box while she reaches into her
bag for something to post. A hand reaches from behind the box, picks up the can
and disappears back behind the box. The woman is flummoxed by the can's
disappearance.
Newman stands nonchalantly beside a dumpster with a plastic sack
containing some bottles and cans. In the dumpster, Kramer roots about beneath the
plastic and cardboard, before coming up and handing a bottle to Newman, who drops
it into his sack.
In Monk's, a waitress puts a tray of empty bottle onto a shelf behind
Kramer, who's eating a meal. As she leaves, he reaches behind him, takes the
tray and tips the bottles into another plastic sack.
Newman stands in a doorway on the street. A homeless guy pushes a
shopping cart full of bottles and cans past. Newman drops a few coins onto the
sidewalk, attracting the attention of the homeless guy, who leaves his cart to
retrieve the change. Newman darts from the doorway, grabs hold of the cart and
races away down the street, leaving the homeless guy shaking a fist and yelling
after him.
Newman finishes a bottle of soda and hands the empty to Kramer, who
Hands another bottle to Newman. There's a long line of empty bottles already
on the table and Newman's looking close to capacity. As Newman reluctantly
begins to drink this latest one, Kramer opens another and taps him on the
stomach, causing Newman to splutter and spray soda across the table.
A cigar-smoking Kramer and a gleeful Newman, regard the back of a mail
truck, filled with plastic sacks of bottles and cans. They slap palms and
shake hands as Kramer pulls down the door and flips the handle closed.
 

[YANKEE STADIUM
George's Office]
George has his head down on his desk. Wilhelm walks jauntily along the
Corridor and enters the office.

WILHELM
So...
George snaps awake.

WILHELM
...did you go down to payroll?

GEORGE
(standing) Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll...
Paid off.

WILHELM
(pleased) Well then, I guess you'll be heading downtown then,
huh?

GEORGE
Oh, yeah. Downtown. Definitely.

WILHELM
Well, I'm very interested to see how this thing turns out.

GEORGE
(to himself) Yeah, you said it. (to Wilhelm) Uh, excuse me, Mr
Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really
necessary, you know, for the project?

WILHELM
Oh no, you've got to go downtown, George. It's all downtown.
Just like the song says.

GEORGE
The song?

WILHELM
There's your answer. Downtown.
Wilhelm leaves.

GEORGE
(thoughtful) Downtown.
 
[Monk's]
George and Jerry in a booth.

JERRY
The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?

GEORGE
Yeah.

JERRY
You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be
Going downtown?

GEORGE
I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some
sort of a
meaning.

JERRY
Okay, so how does it go?

GEORGE
'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can
always go...'

JERRY
'... downtown.'

GEORGE
'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never
close...'

JERRY
'...downtown.'

GEORGE
Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.'
What's a little place that never closes?

JERRY
Seven-eleven?

GEORGE
'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger
on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are
pretty. The Broadway area?

JERRY
No, that's midtown.

GEORGE
'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your
troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'

JERRY
'...down town.'

GEORGE
'Things'll be great, when you're...'

JERRY
'...downtown.'

GEORGE
I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing.

JERRY
Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you.
There are movie shows...'

GEORGE
You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I
Should confess?

JERRY
How can you lose?
 
[Jerry's Apartment/Elaine's Office]
Jerry enters. He goes to his answering machine and plays the messages.

TONY (O.S.)
Yeah, Jerry, it's Tony Abato at the shop. Look, we gotta
talk. You better come down, any time after four.
Jerry looks less than happy at the prospect. The phone rings, and Jerry
answers.

JERRY
Hello.

ELAINE
Hi, it's me.

JERRY
Oh, hi.

ELAINE
Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.

JERRY
Oh, you know what?

ELAINE
(worry) Oh no. What?

JERRY
Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.

ELAINE
You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?

JERRY
I forgot.

ELAINE
Oh, go down and get them.

JERRY
I can't. The car's at the mechanics.

ELAINE
Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll
just go and pick 'em up myself.

JERRY
No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can
not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if
you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?

ELAINE
(resigned) Ugh, okay, alright, fine.
 
[Outside Auto Shop]
Jerry looks a touch anxious as Tony approaches. Tony is still real
intense.

JERRY
Hey, Tony.

TONY
Thanks for coming in, Jerry.

JERRY
Sure.

TONY
I think I know what's goin' on here, and I just wanna hear it
from you. But I want you to be straight with me. Don't lie to me, Jerry. You know
that motor oil you're puttin' in there? (reproachful) From one of those
quicky lube places, isn't it?

JERRY
Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down
here...

TONY
Jerry, motor oil is the lifeblood of a car. Okay, you put in a
low-grade oil, you could damage vital engine parts. Okay. (holds up component)
See this gasket? (throws it down) I have no confidence in that gasket.

JERRY
I really wanna...

TONY
Here's what I wanna do. I wanna overhaul the entire engine. But
it's gonna take a major commitment from you. You're gonna have to keep it under
sixty miles an hour for a while. You gotta come in, and you gotta get the oil
changed every thousand miles.

JERRY
How much money is this gonna cost me?

TONY
(contempt) Huh. I don't understand you. It's your own car we're
Talking about. You know you wrote the wrong mileage down on the form? You
barely know the car. You don't know the mileage, you don't know the tyre pressure.
When was the last time you even checked the washer fluid?

JERRY
The washer fluid is fine.

TONY
(angry) The washer fluid is not fine!

JERRY
Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm
gonna bring it someplace else.

TONY
What d'you mean?

JERRY
Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my
way.

TONY
Well, the car's on a lift.

JERRY
Well, just get it down.

TONY
(subdued) Alright. Okay. Well, uhm, wait here and I'll uh, I'll
bring it around.

JERRY
Okay. Thank you, very much.
Tony walks away into the auto shop. Elaine arrives.

ELAINE
Hey. Where's the car?

JERRY
He's bringing it.

ELAINE
Good.
There is the sound of a car starting up, then a squeal of tires and
Jerry's Saab emerges from the auto shop at high speed. It passes Jerry and Elaine and
Races away down the street. They stare open-mouthed after the car, and at
each other in astonishment.
End.
[Montage of snippets]

JERRY (V.O.)
Last week on Seinfeld.
A sequence of clips from The Bottle Deposit (1) establishes the story 

SO FAR
Newman and Kramer are using a USPS mail truck to run deposit bottles 
and cans to Michigan, in order to collect 10 cents on each of them. George has been 
given an assignment by Mr Wilhelm, but he hasn't a clue what it is. Elaine 
outbids Sue-Ellen Mishke at an auction, to buy John F Kennedy's golf clubs on 
behalf of Mr Peterman, and leaves them in the back of Jerry's car. Kramer and 
Newman have left groceries under the hood of Jerry's car, meaning Jerry has to take 
it to Tony the mechanic, who loves the car more than Jerry does. When Jerry 
asks for his car back, Tony flees in it, taking JFK's clubs with him.
[Outside Auto Shop]
Jerry and Elaine are outside the autoshop. Jerry is on the payphone.

JERRY
Okay, thank you. (hangs up the phone)

ELAINE
So? What'd they say?

JERRY
They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.

ELAINE
What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!

JERRY
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth 
Whitehead, did I?

ELAINE
What kind of maniac is this guy?

JERRY
He's a very special maniac.

ELAINE
What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.

JERRY
I don't know.

ELAINE
Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
[Elaine's Office]
Elaine at her desk. Peterman enters.

PETERMAN
Well, are they here?

ELAINE
Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.

PETERMAN
Snag?

ELAINE
It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my 
friend's car.

PETERMAN
What does that have to do with my clubs?

ELAINE
They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Jerry is talking with a police detective at his door.

DETECTIVE
What was the suspect wearing at the time of the incident?

JERRY
You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme 
ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?

DETECTIVE
All the time. A mechanic forms an emotional attachment, 
thinks he'sgonna lose the car, he panics, he does something rash. I'm gonna ask 
you somepersonal questions. I'm sorry if I touch a nerve, but I think it'll 
help with the case. Had you been taking good care of the car?

JERRY
Had I been taking...?

DETECTIVE
Well, did you leave the A/C on? Do you zip over speed bumps? 
Do you ride the clutch? Things like that.

JERRY
W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I 
want with it.
The detective stares at Jerry.

JERRY
Not that I would think of doing such things.

DETECTIVE
(making a note) Alright Mr Seinfeld, we'll let you know if 
we find anything. I gotta be honest with you, these cases never end up well.

JERRY
Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks.

[YANKEE STADIUM
George's Office]
George sits at his desk, his forehead resting on a folder he has 
clutched in his hands. Mr Wilhelm enters, looking happy.

GEORGE
(hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...

WILHELM
That's what I came to talk to you about. Great job George. 
(shakes George's hand) You really nailed it.

GEORGE
I did?

WILHELM
Oh yes, I read through it this morning. I couldn't have done 
it better myself, and I turned it right over to Mr Steinbrenner. Good work 
George.
Wilhelm leaves. George looks stunned and confused.
[Jerry's Apartment]
By now, George is looking much more pleased.

JERRY
I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow 
it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.

GEORGE
Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it 
was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea 
who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy 
crack corn and I don't care.
[Mr Wilhelm's Home]
Wilhelm sits on the couch. He has a newspaper and is talking to his 
wife, who's in another room.

WILHELM
The gardener did a nice job planting the rose bushes, didn't 
he dear?

MRS WILHELM (O.C.)
You planted the rose bushes, dear.

WILHELM
I did?

MRS WILHELM (O.C.)
Yesterday. You remember.

WILHELM
(thinks for a moment) That's right. (pause) What's for dinner?

MRS WILHELM (O.C.)
We just ate. Did you forget to take your medicine?
Wilhelm can be seen struggling to recollect.
[Jerry's Apartment]
A still pleased looking George is fetching a drink from Jerry's fridge.

GEORGE
The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with 
the car?

JERRY
No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I 
just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.

GEORGE
Why not?

JERRY
They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the 
keys.
The door opens and Elaine enters.

ELAINE
(to George) Hey.

GEORGE
Hey.

ELAINE
(to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say?

JERRY
They're looking.

GEORGE
I gotta go.
George leaves. The phone rings and Jerry picks up.

JERRY
Y'hello.

DETECTIVE (V.O.)
Mr Seinfeld?

JERRY
Yeah.

DETECTIVE (V.O.)
It's Detective McMahon...
Elaine looks quizzical. Jerry mouths, 'It's the police'

DETECTIVE (V.O.)
...I'm at the warehouse on Pier 38. Ah, I think you'd 
better get down here.

JERRY
Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car.

ELAINE
(makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him.

JERRY
Are there golf clubs in the back?

DETECTIVE (V.O.)
We really can't tell. You better bring your service 
records.
[Pier 38 Warehouse]
The interior of the warehouse is gloomy and dank. There are cars and 
parts of cars arranged round the area, together with tools, welding gear, etc. 
Detective McMahon stands beside a car-shaped object hidden under a white sheet. 
Jerry and Elaine are led in by a young patrolman who looks queasy.

YOUNG COP
Watch where you step. There's quite a bit of... grease. 
Detective, Jerry Seinfeld is here.

DETECTIVE
How d'you do. Thanks for coming down.

JERRY
(indicating) This is Elaine Benes.

ELAINE
(explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends.

DETECTIVE
I see.

JERRY
Yeah.

DETECTIVE
I'm sorry to make you go through this, but we need to make 
sure.

JERRY
Well, what's going on? What is this thing?

DETECTIVE
One of our patrolmen stumbled over this.
He lifts the sheet, revealing what's beneath to Jerry and Elaine.

ELAINE
(horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth)

JERRY
Oh my God!
The young patrolman removes his cap out of respect for the victim.

DETECTIVE
The block is nearly split apart. We found the overhead cams 
thirty feet away. We can only hope the body sold for scrap.

ELAINE
Oh, my God.

DETECTIVE
And we know it's a Saab. The angle on the Vee-6 is 
definitely ninety-two. The model is hard to determine because the drive train is 
all burnt out.

JERRY
What is that smell?

DETECTIVE
Look at the clutch.
They look. Jerry and Elaine don't like what they see.

ELAINE
Uuh.
The patrolman cracks and leaves hurriedly, looking nauseous.

YOUNG COP
Excuse me.

DETECTIVE
Whoever did this didn't just dismantle it. I mean, they took 
their time, they had fun. They were very systematic. They went out of their 
way to gouge the sides of every piston, and the turbo was separated from the 
housing and shoved right up the exhaust pipe.

ELAINE
Uhh

JERRY
Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.

DETECTIVE
Your car's not a turbo?

JERRY
No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a 
turbo!

ELAINE
(sobbing happiness) It's a tu-hur-bo.
Elaine and Jerry hug in happiness. In the background, another woman 
arrives.

WOMAN
Excuse me, did you say turbo? Saab turbo nine-thousand? Is it... 
(voice breaking) midnight blue?

DETECTIVE
(condolences) Yes ma'am.
[Mail Truck]
Newman drives as he and Kramer give voice to their happiness.

KRAMER/NEWMAN
(singing) Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine 
bottle and cans in the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine bottles 
and cans. At ten cents a bottle and ten cents a can, we're pulling in five 
hundred dollars a man. Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottle and cans in 
the trunk, nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-eight bottles and cans. 
We fill up with gas, we count up our cash!!...
Their singing ends shambolically as they lose track of the lyrics. But 
the pair still look gleeful.
[Jerry's Apartment/Jerry's car]
The phone rings in Jerry's apartment. He picks it up.

JERRY
Hello.

TONY
Hey Jerry, it's Tony.

JERRY
Tony, where are you?
The Saab is driving down a quiet country road at night.

TONY
Aw look, I just want you to know that the car is fine. I got her 
all fixed up. We're in a nice area, no potholes, no traffic. So there's nothing 
to worry about. Okay? In fact, here, somebody wants to talk to you.
Tony holds the phone toward the dash and revs the engine a little. 
Jerry can hear the engine noise over the phone.

JERRY
Tony, y-you better bring that car back!

TONY
(angry) Nobody's giving anything back! You tried to take it from 
me, I don't forget that.

JERRY
Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!

TONY
Oh, your car. You want your car back!

JERRY
Tony.

TONY
Listen, that registration may have your name on it, Jerry. But 
this engine's running on my sweat and my blood.
Tony hangs up the phone.

JERRY
(exasperated) Where do I find these guys?
[Mail Truck]
Kramer is driving the truck along a highway in daylight.

NEWMAN
How much gas we got?

KRAMER
Three quarters of a tank.
Newman punches the numbers into a calculator.

KRAMER
That's better than we estimated.

NEWMAN
(smugly) That is seven dollars and twenty-two cents better.
They give a smug little laugh.

NEWMAN
Maybe we could uh, stop for a snack.

KRAMER
Ah, no, that's not in the budget.

NEWMAN
Yeah well, the budget changed, you know. I mean, it might be a 
good investment.

KRAMER
That's not a good investment, that's a loss.
A convertible black Saab passes the mail truck.

KRAMER
Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check 
out that license plate.
He accelerates the mail truck to close on the Saab, and leans forward, 
straining to make out the plate.

KRAMER
Yeah, those are New York plates.

NEWMAN
Is that Jerry's number?

KRAMER
I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are 
pretty good odds.
Kramer reaches under his seat, rummaging for something.

NEWMAN
What're you doing?

KRAMER
I'm calling Jerry.

NEWMAN
On what?

KRAMER
Brought my phone.
He pulls out his mobile and hits the speed dial for Jerry.
[Jerry's Apartment/Mail Truck]

JERRY
(answering phone) Y'hello.

KRAMER
Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?

JERRY
Why, what's up?

KRAMER
Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.

JERRY
Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a 
second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728.

KRAMER
(checks the car ahead of him) Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, 
uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.

JERRY
Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.

KRAMER
Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.

JERRY
Good work Kramer, this is incredible.

KRAMER
Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on 
a monkey! I'll check back with you.
[Elaine's Office/Jerry's Apartment]
The phone rings in Elaine's office. She answers it.

ELAINE
Elaine Benes.

JERRY
Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car!

ELAINE
Oh my god, where is it?

JERRY
It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.

ELAINE
Are the clubs there?

JERRY
I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call 
me back.

ELAINE
Alright, I'm heading over right now.
[Jerry's Apartment]
Elaine enters at a rush.

ELAINE
What's the status?

JERRY
Last check-in, they were still on him.

ELAINE
Well, have they called the police yet?

JERRY
No, they won't call the police.

ELAINE
What? Why not?

JERRY
They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. 
Kramer doesn't want a record.

ELAINE
Kramer has a record.

JERRY
Not a Federal record.
The phone rings. Jerry grabs the handset by the couch, Elaine picks up 
in the kitchen.
[Mail Truck/Jerry's Apartment]

ELAINE/JERRY
Kramer?

JERRY
What's going on?

KRAMER
Yeah, nothing. We're still following him.
Ahead of the truck, the black Saab indicates his intention to move onto 
the off-ramp.

KRAMER
Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going 
south on the one-thirty-five.

ELAINE
Keep following him.

KRAMER
Alright, alright, I'll follow him.

NEWMAN
Hey, we can't follow him, we're going north to Michigan.

KRAMER
Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our 
way.

ELAINE
I need those clubs.

JERRY
Kramer, I want my car.

KRAMER
Well, I don't know what to do.

NEWMAN
Hey, we got ten thousand deposit bottles here. I mean, this guy 
could be going to Arkansas.

JERRY
Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.

NEWMAN
Hey, don't listen to him. I mean, we can't afford a detour. Our 
budget won't hold it.

KRAMER
Well, I don't know what to do man!

NEWMAN
Kramer! Stay left. Left, left, left.

ELAINE/JERRY
Right. Go right!/South!

KRAMER
Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
Kramer swerves onto the off-ramp at the last moment. Tyres squeal and 
the truck sways.
[Mail Truck]

NEWMAN
I hope you realise what you've done. You've destroyed our whole 
venture.

KRAMER
This ramp is steep.

NEWMAN
All my work, my planning, my genius. All for nought.

KRAMER
Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away 
from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel.
Newman reaches across and takes the steering wheel as Kramer gets out 
of the driving seat.

NEWMAN
What're you doing?

KRAMER
(climbing though into the back of the truck) I'm gonna get 
something.

NEWMAN
Are you crazy?
The truck swerves as Newman slides into the driving seat.

KRAMER
Keep your foot on the gas.
Kramer shoves his way through the sackloads of bottles and cans.

NEWMAN
Hey! You're not dumping those bottles back there, are you?
Kramer slides open the rear door of the truck.

NEWMAN
Hey Kramer, those have wholesale value! We could cut our 
losses.
Kramer grabs a sack and heaves it out the back of the truck.

KRAMER
Look out below!!
Car horns can be heard as the sack lands in the carriageway. Kramer 
grabs another sack and hurls that out, with another yelled warning.

[YANKEE STADIUM
Steinbrenner's Office]
Steinbrenner sits behind his desk. He's examining something on his 
desktop with a large powerful magnifying glass.

STEINBRENNER
(to himself) With this magnifying glass, I feel like a 
scientist.
There is a tap at the door, and George cautiously enters.

GEORGE
You wanted to see me, sir?

STEINBRENNER
Ah, come in George, come in.
George strolls up to Big Stein's desk, looking more confident.

STEINBRENNER
Uh, Wilhelm gave me this project you worked on.

GEORGE
(smiling) Yes sir.

STEINBRENNER
Let me ask you something, George. You having any personal 
problems at home? Girl trouble, love trouble of any kind?

GEORGE
(wondering where this is leading) No sir.

STEINBRENNER
What about drugs? You doing some of that crack cocaine? 
You on the pipe?

GEORGE
(worried now) No sir.

STEINBRENNER
Are you seeing a psychiatrist? Bcause I got a flash for 
you young man, you're non compos mentis! You got some bats in the belfry!

GEORGE
What're.. What're you talking about?

STEINBRENNER
George, I've read this report. It's very troubling, very 
troubling indeed. It's a sick mind at work here.
Two burly guys who are clearly medical orderlies come into the room 
behind George.

STEINBRENNER
Okay, come on boys, come on in here. George, this is Herb 
and Dan.
George regards the two guys, very nervously as they approach him and 
stand behind him, one on either shoulder.

STEINBRENNER
They're gonna take you away to a nice place where you can 
get some help. They're very friendly people there. My brother-in-law was there 
for a couple of weeks. The man was obsessed with lactating women. They 
completely cured him, although he still eats a lot of cheese.
Herb and Dan take hold of George's arms. George gets panicky.

GEORGE
Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not 
mine.
Herb and Dan begin to drag the struggling George across the office 
toward the door.

STEINBRENNER
Of course you didn't George. Of course you didn't write 
it.

GEORGE
I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got 
done, but it did.
As Herb and Dan haul George through the door, George makes his last 
stand, trying to get a hold on the doorframe with his feet. Eventually he is 
dragged out into the corridor and vanishes from view.

STEINBRENNER
Of course. Of course it got done. Things get done all the 
time, I understand. (as George disappears) Don't worry, your job'll be waiting 
for you when you get back. (banging his fist on his desk) Get better George. 
Get better!
[Mail Truck]
The Saab travels down a quiet country road at night, followed by the 
mail truck. Kramer is driving, Newman looks furious in the passenger seat.

KRAMER
(frustrated) Damn. I don't understand this. I've ditched every 
bottle and can, and we still can't gain. It's like we're...
He looks across at the substantial bulk of Newman and a thought occurs.

KRAMER
...sluggish.

NEWMAN
I went through all those bottles and all those cans, for what? 
What a waste. And I'm really gonna catch hell for those missing mailbags.

KRAMER
Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there?

NEWMAN
(perks up) A pie stand? Where?

KRAMER
Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back.

NEWMAN
Aww, c'mon, pull over, pull over will ya.
Kramer pulls the truck into the roadside. As it halts, Newman sticks 
his head out the window to peer back down the road.

NEWMAN
Where? I..I..I don't see it.

KRAMER
Well open the door, you get a better look.
Newman slides back the door and leans out.

NEWMAN
I don't see any pie...
Kramer plants his foot firmly in Newman's backside and heaves him out 
of the truck.

NEWMAN
...Aargh!
As Newman lands heavily in the verge, Kramer slides the door shut and 
drives away.

NEWMAN
Kramer!!

KRAMER
I'm sorry Newman, you were holding us back.

NEWMAN
(after speeding truck) Kramer!!
In the mail truck, Kramer picks up his phone and redials.

KRAMER
(shouting) Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running 
lean. We're back on track, buddy!
[Country Roadside]
Newman wanders forlornly along the roadside at night. He tries to thumb 
a ride from passing traffic, displaying his uniform insignia to drivers.

NEWMAN
Federal employee. Federal employee.
Aside from a few blaring car horns, he gets no response. He continues 
his trudge, a sour look on his face.
[Countryside]
Newman struggles up a steep slope.
Newman pushes his way through a field of crops. He emerges from the 
vegetation and sees a farmhouse, its lights blazing. His face lights up. He 
stumbles towards the welcoming lights, tripping and falling, before picking 
himself up and running up to the building.
[Farm]
Newman reaches the steps to the porch and stumbles up them. As he 
reaches the door, a scent catches his attention. Looking to the window, he sees a 
pie left out on the window sill to cool. A craftier look comes to his face. He 
turns back to the door and knocks. After a few seconds, it opens.

FARMER
Hello stranger.

NEWMAN
(a touch desperate) Ah, look, I..I'm sorry to bother you, but 
I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of 
backwoods mail-hating survivalists.

FARMER
Calm down, now. Calm down. Don't worry, we'll take care of you. 
This farm ain't much, but uh, you're welcome to what we have. Hot bath, 
hearty meal, clean bed.

NEWMAN
Oh, thank you, sir.

FARMER
Just have one rule. Keep your hands off my daughter.
Just then, the daughter in question slinks up behind the farmer. 
Blonde, twenty-ish, just one walking temptation.
[Mail Truck/Jerry's Apartment]
Kramer has the mail truck right behind Jerry's Saab as they race along 
a quiet country road.

KRAMER
Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's 
running scared, buddy.
Jerry and Elaine are sitting on the couch, each with a phone handset.

JERRY
How's the gas situation?

KRAMER
(checks dial) I got enough to get to Memphis.
In front of him, Tony reaches into the back seat of the Saab.

KRAMER
He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something.
Tony extracts a long, metallic object from behind himself.

KRAMER
He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!!

JERRY
Duck, Kramer! Duck!
Kramer crouches as far as he can. Tony flings the object at Kramer's 
mail truck. It crashes against the windshield and bounces away.

KRAMER
It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me!

ELAINE
Those are JFK's golf clubs!
Tony hurls another club at the mail truck. Again, it bounces off the 
windshield, leaving some cracks.

KRAMER
Hey, I'm under fire here. (another club hits) I'm under heavy 
fire here, boy. (another hit) Jeez! That was a five-iron!

ELAINE
Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!

JERRY
No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.

KRAMER
Wait a minute, I think he's done. (peers at the Saab) Oh no, 
he's taking out the woods!
Tony flings a heavy wood at the truck.

KRAMER
(noise)
The Saab leads the truck down the road, with Tony hurling club after 
club over his shoulder and into the front of the truck.

KRAMER
(yelling at Tony) You'll have to do a lot better than that!
Tony hurls the golf bag at the truck. It slams solidly against the 
windshield, Kramer flinches, the truck swerves. The front wheel runs over a club on 
the tarmac and the tyre bursts.

JERRY
(hearing the noises) What's happening!
The truck is rattling and lurching as it struggles along the road.

KRAMER
This truck is dying. We're losing him.
The Saab easily outpaces the truck and accelerates away. The truck 
staggers to a halt, giving out a death rattle. A cloud of steam and smoke erupts from 
under the hood.

KRAMER
I think we lost him.

JERRY
(disappointment) Dammit!

ELAINE
(quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?

KRAMER
(subdued) Yeah, yeah, I'll get 'em.
Jerry hangs up.
[Country]
Kramer climbs out of the truck and looks back down the road. He kicks 
the deflated tyre. Coming to the front of the truck, he picks a club off 
the front bumper and pulls the broken shaft of another out of the radiator 
grille.
Kramer walks along the road with the bent and broken clubs. He comes 
upon the bag and transfers the clubs into it. Slinging it over his shoulder, he 
continues on his way, picking up more battered golf clubs as he goes.
[Farm]
Newman, the farmer and the farmer's daughter sit round the kitchen 
table. They are working their way through a generous meal.

FARMER
Enjoy that mutton?

NEWMAN
(mouth full) It's delicious mutton. This is uh, this is outta 
sight. I would, I would love to get the recipe. It's very good.
The farmer's daughter is staring at Newman and toying with her fork, 
touching it to her lips and teeth. (It's difficult to be arousing with cutlery, but 
she's giving it a pretty good shot.) Newman notices this and tries to take a
nonchalant sip from a glass, but it goes down the wrong way and he 
splutters.

FARMER
That cider too strong for you?

NEWMAN
No, no. I love strong cider. (for the farmer's daughter's 
benefit) I'm a big, strong, cider guy.
The farmer's daughter licks her lips.

FARMER
Gonna be milking Holsteins in the morning, if you'd like to 
lend a hand.

NEWMAN
(reluctant) You know, I don't really know that much about uh.. 
I don't have any.. I don't.. I don't think I know much about that.

FARMER
Ahh, Susie here'll teach you.
The farmer's daughter goes wide eyed.

FARMER
Just gotta pull on the teat a little.
Susie and Newman half-laugh nervously.

SUSIE
(suggestive) Nice having a big, strong, man around.

NEWMAN
You know, those mail bags, they get mighty heavy. I uh, I 
Nautilus, of course. (puffs out his chest)
The farmer looks at him oddly.

NEWMAN
(breaking from his pose) Can I have some gravy?
[Institution]
George is using a payphone in the corner of the room. His free hand is 
holding the waistband of his trousers. In the background are a couple of 
inmates and visitors, and an orderly. Notable among them are Pop and Deena Lazzari,
previously seen in 'The Gum'.

GEORGE
(desperate) Steinbrenner had me committed! I'm in the nuthouse!

DEENA
I'll be back same time next week, Pop.

GEORGE
(quieter desperation) They took my belt, Jerry. I got nothing 
to hold my pants up. (listens) Well, you gotta come over here now! Just tell 'em 
what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.
Deena spots George as she makes her way out of the room.

DEENA
George?
George looks like his salvation has arrived. He hangs up the phone.

DEENA
I see you're finally getting some help.

GEORGE
Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. (he hugs Deena) Thank God you're 
here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay. 
You know that I don't belong in here.

DEENA
George, this is the best thing for you. (she walks away)

GEORGE
Yea... (sinks in) What? No, no!
As he tries to follow Deena, the orderly grabs hold of him and 
restrains him.

GEORGE
Deena! Deena, wait a... Deena, help!
George is almost in tears and hops from foot to foot in frustration as 
the orderly holds him. Pop Lazzari wanders over.

POP
Is that little Georgie C? How's the folks? You still got that nice 
little car?
[Countryside]
Kramer approaches a familiar farmhouse. As he mounts the steps up to 
the porch, a commotion erupts inside the place. A gunshot rings out and the 
farmer's daughter screams. Kramer flinches. The farmer can be heard yelling 
angrily. The door is flung open and Newman runs out pulling up his trousers.

NEWMAN
(screaming in panic) Aaah!! Aaah!

KRAMER
What you doing?!

NEWMAN
(pushing past Kramer) Kramer, help me! Help me!
Newman sets off running. From the door of the farmhouse comes the 
farmer, armed with a shotgun, closely followed by his daughter, whose shirt is undone 
and hair is dishevelled.

KRAMER
(takes one look and sets off after Newman) Jeez!

FARMER
(taking aim) I told you to keep away from my daughter!
As Kramer and Newman reach the edge of the crops, the farmer fires a 
shot. Both Newman and Kramer leap in the air and run into the cover of the crop. 
Before the farmer can fire again, his daughter pushes the barrel of the shotgun 
downward, spoiling his aim.

SUSIE
No daddy, you'll hurt him! I love him! (waving after Newman) 
Goodbye Norman, goodbye.
[Elaine's Office]
Elaine is sitting with her head in her hands. Peterman enters at a 
rush.

PETERMAN
(excited) Elaine! You found the clubs. That's wonderful news. 
Where are they?

ELAINE
(not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr 
Peterman.

PETERMAN
Oh, I'll be inaugrating them this weekend, with none other 
than Ethel Kennedy. A woman whose triumph in the face of tragedy is exceeded only 
by her proclivity to procreate.
Elaine puts the bag of clubs down beside Peterman. The clubs are, of 
course, wrecked. Elaine looks like she's expecting a poor reaction. Peterman 
picks up a club or two, staring in disbelief at the twisted metal.

ELAINE
The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there.

PETERMAN
Elaine. I never knew Kennedy had such a temper.

ELAINE
(spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing 
worse was his slice. (she laughs nervously)

PETERMAN
See you on Monday.
Peterman picks up the bag and heads for the door.

ELAINE
Have a good game.
End.

OPENING MONOLOGUE

JERRY
I think that if the wedding invitations were left up to the men, we'd just
drive around sticking flyers in windshields ...y' know... Not even typed up either,
just Magic Marker, Zerox, you know...Party!!..
What's needed is a divorce announcement; Mr and Mrs Fred Johnson are requesting the honour
of your presence at the "returning" of their daughter back to Mr,and Mrs Fred Johnson.

OUTSIDE MELODY STATIONERIES
Susan and George walk into the store and go up the sales clerk.

SUSAN
Hi.

CLERK
Hi.. May I help you?

SUSAN
Yes, we'd like some wedding invitations.

CLERK
Ohh! Well...Congratulations

SUSAN
(happily) Thank you.

GEORGE
(mildly embarrassed) yeah.. Thank you.

CLERK
When 's the wedding?

SUSAN
June

GEORGE
late June.

CLERK
Oh! Well, we have quite a few to pick from ( turns around and picks up a huge binder)
They're arranged in order of price , the most expensive are in the front.
George takes the binder and feigns browsing and flips right to the last page.

GEORGE
He..hmmm. humm...What about this one.

CLERK
Hmmm,..to tell you the truth they haven't manufactured that one for a number of years.
I might have couple of boxes left in our warehouse in New Jersey. I'd have to check.

SUSAN
Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that.

GEORGE
What's the difference you just read it and mail it right back. These we'll do.

SUSAN
Why don't they make'em anymore?

CLERK
Well.. For one thing the glue isn't very adhesive. It takes a lot of moisture to make them stick.

GEORGE
So we pick up some Elmers

SUSAN
(disappointed)All right. You see what I do for you.
Scene cuts to the street as Susan and George are about to get into a cab. Kramer happens to walk by.

GEORGE
Hey! Kramer.

KRAMER
Hey! George.....Lily..

SUSAN
No. Susan.

KRAMER
No. No It's Lily

SUSAN

GEORGE
It's Susan

KRAMER

Scene cuts to Jerry's apt. George walks in . Jerry is coming out of his bedroom twiddling scissors.

GEORGE
It's coming Jerry, it's coming.

JERRY
What's coming?

GEORGE
The Day..

JERRY

GEORGE
We ordered the wedding invitations today,, Nothing can stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's
happening. Can I do this? I can't do this...Look at me. Look at me I can't do this, I can't do this (manic)
Help me Jerry , help me.

JERRY
why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's over

GEORGE
I can't

JERRY
Why not?
George; 'Cause I can't face that scene. You know what kind of scene that would be? i'd rather be unhappy
for the rest of my life than go through something like that. (forceful) I CAN'T, I CAN'T.
I tried to psyche myself up a million times I cannot go through that.

JERRY
All right take it easy, just take it easy.

GEORGE
What about a letter?

JERRY
A letter.

GEORGE
I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear in a sea of people for like
six months, a year you know just while things simmer down. Ehm.. Ehm...Dear Susan. I'm sorry.
I made a terrible mistake. I'm really , really sorry.

JERRY
That's it?

GEORGE
What? Too short?

BOTH
Seems a little short, yeah..

JERRY
You can't go to China What about your job?

GEORGE
My Job..arghhh

JERRY
So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in
Staten Island than China believe me.

GEORGE
Yeah! Yeah!..Staten Island . What about my clothes ,how do I get the rest of the clothes?

JERRY
Aagh! You come back for your clothes

GEORGE
I'm not going back in there.

JERRY
So forget about your clothes.

GEORGE
Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!
Jerry; Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.

GEORGE
If she'd just take a plane somewhere.

JERRY
And what, hope for a crash?

GEORGE
It happens.

JERRY
You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.

GEORGE
It's something . It's hope.
Elaine comes through the door

ELAINE

GEORGE
What do you mean?

ELAINE

GEORGE
I don't know. I don't think you're anything.

ELAINE
Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid.

GEORGE
Those are Susan's friends.

ELAINE
Well then...aaahh how about being an usher?

GEORGE
Well...I'll ask Susan about it later.

ELAINE
You don't ask.. You tell.

GEORGE
( to Jerry) What about the letter, should I think about the letter?

JERRY
Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?

ELAINE
Start smoking.

GEORGE
Smoking.

JERRY
Does she hate cigarettes?

GEORGE
Yes, she hates cigarettes.

JERRY
But you don't smoke.

GEORGE
Nooooooo......
Scene cuts to Jerry and Elaine walking

JERRY
You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.

ELAINE
Really?

JERRY
Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester.
I'll never see him again.

ELAINE
Yeah! You're probably right.

JERRY
Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.

ELAINE
No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single.
I'm getting out.

JERRY
So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.

ELAINE
Yep! just you and Kramer.
Elaine walks away

JERRY
See you ... me and Kramer...
Daydreaming sequence set in Jerry's apt. in a probable future. Kramer pops in. They look a
little older.

KRAMER
Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see
the traffic.

JERRY
(annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine
and there's no room for a periscope in a car.

KRAMER
Huh! You make a higher roof.

JERRY
They're not making higher roofs.

KRAMER
why can't you make a higher roof.

JERRY
Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
As Jerry slowly comes out of his doze he is about to cross the street as a car comes to him at high speed.

JERRY
.....Stupid , stupid.

JEANNIE
Hey! Hey! Look out. (she pulls him back saving his life.) OK!, Are you okay?

JERRY
Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.

JEANNIE
Shouldn't there be some kind of reward for that.

JERRY
oh! thank you.

JEANNIE
You know you should be a lot more careful crossing the street like that, otherwise you could die..
If that bothers you.

JERRY
Well I...

JEANNIE
You see..(points to his collar) To me this is a waste.

JERRY
What?

JEANNIE
The shirt you got on under your sweather.It sits for three weeks in your drawer, waiting to come
out. and when it finally does . It sticks up only half an inch out of your collar.

JERRY
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.

JEANNIE
Jeannie Steinman.

JERRY
Hey! Same initials . How do you like that?

JEANNIE
I like it.
 
George and Susan at their apt.

GEORGE
Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the
wedding

SUSAN
No. Out of the question. I don't want any women ushers at my wedding and while we're on the
subject, Kramer is not an usher either.
George; Why not?

SUSAN
He doesn't even know my name.

GEORGE
That was an honest mistake.

SUSAN
Nah! He's too weird he'd fall or something. He'd ruin the whole ceremony.
George takes out a pack of cigarettes and pulls one out.

GEORGE
Yeah! You're right.. You're probably right.

SUSAN
Whadda doing?

GEORGE
(shrugs and lights it up)

SUSAN
Since when do you smoke?

GEORGE

SUSAN
I've never seen you smoke.

GEORGE
Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave it up for a while but it was too tough.
Y' know.....I got no will power.

SUSAN
I don't like this one bit.

GEORGE
Well(coughs) I can't stop now...(coughs) I'm addicted...(words missing)

SUSAN
Well you are gonna have to quit.
George sprints to the bathroom

GEORGE
Oh my god....

At Jerry's. Kramer comes in Jerry is on the couch.

KRAMER
Hey! Did you hear the bank on the corner is offering a 100 dollars if you go in there and they
don't greet you with a hello?

JERRY
Uh! Really .That's nice.

KRAMER
Now what's with you?

JERRY
I think I'm in love.

KRAMER
Oh. Come on.

JERRY
No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then
we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.

KRAMER
If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.

JERRY
No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me.
She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised
what's going on.

KRAMER
What?

JERRY
Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless)
I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.

KRAMER
You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!!
At the HOME FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK Kramer walks up to a teller.

KRAMER
Hey!

TELLER

TELLER

KRAMER
Then I'll be back.
In Jerry's hallway

ELAINE
So I'm not gonna be an usher?

GEORGE
No..

ELAINE
So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.

GEORGE
Well Kramer's not an usher anymore.
Kramer; What are you talking about?

GEORGE
You've been demoted.
Kramer; Why?

GEORGE
Because you called her by the wrong name.

KRAMER
But she really looks like a Lily

ELAINE
Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding.

GEORGE
Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing.

ELAINE

GEORGE
Yeah.. They made me sick.

KRAMER
All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ?

GEORGE
Yeah...

KRAMER
All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.

GEORGE
What does that mean?

KRAMER
Ask her to sign a pre-nup.

GEORGE
What does that do?

KRAMER
Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.

GEORGE
They are?... Elaine?

ELAINE
I wouldn't sign one.

GEORGE
Pre-nup of course ..Kramer....

KRAMER
